# AI-for-Energy
The philosophy behind this project is to find ways that governments can benefit from to involve people in accelerating energy transition and taking advantage of sustainable energy resources. In fact, people play an important role besides state-of-the-art technologies and business boosters. How could we get these insights? I used NLP to answer this question.
