Unless such a home uses only electric heating which might bump the KW usage into approximately a two year period, (which is not the case in Europe) this thing has to work for quite a few years before it will pay for itself.  Considering all of the maintenance that these giant towers need making any profit on these is a very risky proposition.  \nThe Moroccan plant is about 13.75 Euro per Watt Installed. That is 13,750 Euro a KiloWatt. The price of KW in Morocco is about 0.12 USD that is about 0.11Euro.  that means that this plant (without any upkeep and maintenance, operation cost, etc.) should work for 13750:0.11=125000 hours. That means that even if this thing works no stop 24 hours a day (which is impossible as you understand) it will pay for itself in roughly 15 years, and since it works only half the day it becomes 30.   This again means that this whole installation will never pay for itself and will be a massive debt on the part of Moroccan people whose politicians agreed to this nonsense for whatever reason. In other words it is a massive scam.  Probably banking.",0,"2 months ago",1579461396000,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

We have no need to transport food around the world; this is the equality the world has overlooked.\n\nOne weekly day of rest for people and businesses is powerful to help save our environment, our families and our unity.

'American Tiny House Association' home tours on the lawn near the Mall, this was very successful with a wide variety of people who rarely agree on important topics.  The couple filming their travels on Tiny House Expedition  has many interesting video on You Tube, especially the series 'Tiny House Community, How to do it Legally.'  2.  Living Big in a Tiny House 3.  Handeeman (he is living off the grid with his wife Hannah a gourmet vegan chef, in Arizona, he is an electrician from Canada, they met online).  He bicycled across South Asia. 4.  This man knows how to save billions of lives:  Bob Ross (or similar name, he's has interviewed hundreds of people and traveled endlessly on the road).  CheapRVLiving series on You Tube.  Who should pay for all of this?  The Jeffrey Epstein fortune; the Bronfman liquor dynasty fortune; the Harvey Weinstein fortune - all the billionaires should be taxed at least one percent to provide 7 billion Tiny Houses that can live in vertical communities Off the Grid.  Each of these high rise buildings should be designed by Richard Gage of 'Architects and Engineers for 9 ll Truth' and 'Firefighters for 9 ll Truth' to make sure every inch is as safe as possible (unless they are sabotaged behind their backs).  24 hour security cameras are necessary everywhere to prevent common arson, which is a current and long term crises in Oakland, California.  Also, the security cameras are necessary to prevent a copy of the rape and murder of an 8 year old girl by a 15 year old neighbor in a friendly arts community apartment building in Santa Cruz, California, a few years ago.  He will probably be free soon, with no one knowing about his rape and murder of an 8 year old.    Each of these Tiny Houses could be raised or lowered on huge 'car elevators' which are common in new apartment buildings in high tech neighborhoods.  'The Vertical Farm' book by Dr. Despommier and African American, Majora Carter, should be used in every building to help recycle and clean rain water, to grow veg, fruit, fish for every person in the building and maybe the surrounding neighborhood.  Every building should have a floor dedicated to using the book, 'The One World School House', by Salman Khan.  This will help lower the deaths of students killed trying to walk or drive to school.  He is an MIT graduate and tested his book in schools near Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California.  Every student should be allowed to do all the course reading, from cover to cover, out lout, on You Tube, without fear of being sued by the author or publisher over the cruel law of 'the reader is limited to four pages of reading this book out loud in any public setting.'

I think this documentary portrays very well the complexity of the problem we stand before. Our energy demands are only  increasing but our sense of awareness to the repercussions of such needs are also increasing. This means we will stand before many difficult decisions now and in the future, and need to carefully weigh out the consequences. Fast acting is not possible, yet it is highly necessary as our carbon budget for a 1.5C scenario is practically depleted already. A long-term planning vision and political framework that enables it is highly needed, but extremely complex in a political landscape that is becoming more and more nationalistic. So, what can we do? I don't have the answer but it is clear that one nation alone will not solve the issue. We need to work together and find common solutions which are not driven by capitalist objectives. \nIn addition to my philosophical rant (thanks for baring with me) I would like to point out that also nuclear power has issues related to GHG emissions, besides the safety hazards.

I'll give you my little writeup for the weak of mind.\n\n\nLets first look at this from incoming light. The Sun, with an effective temperature of approximately 5800 K, is an approximate black body with an emission spectrum peaked in the central, yellow-green part of the visible spectrum. Of that, about 55% of incoming sunlight to Earth is infrared photons. They strike the Earth and are reradiated back out into the atmosphere. The other 45% is white light and of that, about 30% of that is reflected which is what you would see if you were to look at the Earth from outer space. That should leave about 31.5% of the total light being white, to strike the Earth and be reradiated in the Earth's black body 255k infrared range back into the atmosphere. That would mean 55% infrared photons coming in and 86.5% total infrared photons going out. As we increase secondary greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4, O3, N2O, CFCs, and HCFCs, in the atmosphere, we block more incoming infrared photons, slightly cooling off the planet. Being there are more outgoing infrared photons than incoming, we should trap more outgoing infrared photons than reflecting incoming photons. That being said, all things being equal, on the mean, the planet must heat.\n\n\nRead and understand the three laws of thermodynamics and then I'll be happy to explain any questions you have.",0,"9 months ago",1560971802857,false

I dont have questions about it ,except one : Did you at any time done some thinking why occurrences to the earths climate variations ,the last 2000 years ? Most notably  the middle of1300-th ,1570–1710 and1790–1880.?  Not to mention the warming period between  year 950 till 1250 ? Vikings harvest crops on Greenland, you could cultivate and harvest green grapes on the british Isles. That was before we burnt fossil fuel.\nI think , after your little physics-lesson, the principle of thermo-dynamics was applicable even back then ? And so, why dont you start to explain the variation in climate before we had co2 and the temperature variation i explained above. I tell you why. You cant !  Science about climate is flawed as it should. Warming/cooling periods occur without human interaction, that should be lesson number one. There are a lot of Weather-men out there declaring emergency for every drought ,storm and excessive rainfall for a ""Climate Change""  And not see it as a publicity stunt is plain stupidity. The green partys have warned about Acid Rain (Nope no such thing,we would all starve to death) The holes in the Ozone layer ( Well, nobody does speak of this imminent destroyer of humanity no longer ) Rising ocean levels ( OK, where is the evidence?

I think that countries and companies today know well enough that recycling panels with an effective life cycle of lets say 10-15 years is inevitable, materials arend infinitely availabla on earth and it would kind of counter the ""green"" aspect of it. Globally, we are still at the beginning of solar energy in my opinion and with further research the yield will improve. There are also ideas like paint with solar cells in it that might someday produce energy when applied to houses.\n\n\nNuclear is tempting because except for the waste it produces, it basically only emits water vapor (which is also a greenhouse gas, but not as potent as CO2 or methane). However, the contamination of vast areas after a major accident is too high of a risk. Keep in mind that most nuclear power plants are decades old and not up to standard, even in countries such as France.

There is no evidence whatsoever, that so-called Clean Renewable ""Green"" Energy, is sustainable at all, or any cleaner or more efficient than fossil fuels.\n\nPeople the world over are stupid ignorant, because we all have been brainwashed and propaganda indoctrinated by powerful forces They believe what media and governments tell them. But most importantly because people don't do their due diligence research. If they did (and had the time), they would weigh all the evidence, to come to a logical conclusion: There is no Global Warming. Humans have no impact whatsoever on Earth's Climate. The Sun is 1.3 Million times the size of Earth. Solar Radiation and magnetism, controls all Climate on Earth, and within our Solar System. \r\n\r\nCO2 is good. If it came from the Earth and we used it as energy, it went back to the earth. How/Why? Because CO2 is LIFE. Unfortunately  CO2 is almost non-existent. It comprises only .04% of Earth's Atmosphere. Without CO2 there would be no life on Earth whatsoever. CO2 Levels have historically, before human beings or industrialization, been 17 times higher for millions of years, and 10 to 11 times higher for even longer. Less than 2% of all CO2 in the atmosphere comes from human activity. CO2 is plant food. There has been a slight increase of 120 to 130 Parts Per Million, in the last 150 years, from roughly 280 PPM to 410 PPM. At 150 PPM of co2, life on earth ceases to exist.\n\r\nGlobal Warming (now Climate Change after the IPCC was caught fabricating the data), is not happening, and has not been happening since Q2 of 1998. Earth has been in an Ice Age for 12,000 years (Quaternary Glaciation). In 1998 the Sun entered into a period of decreased Solar Radiation, called a Grand Solar Minimum. That in turn began Global Cooling. We have been in a slight cooling trend, since then. The Climate is changing constantly and it has been happening ever since the planet has existed. It has nothing whatsoever to do with human beings or industrialization (or CO2, or Greenhouse Gases). This entire false agenda: Global Warming is a $Multi-Trillion dollar scam for financial gain, and Control over the world. \r\n\r\nIt is the largest Conspiracy arguably, in human history. Global Warming = U.N. Agenda 21 (IPCC) = Sustainable Development/Smart Growth = Communist World Government under the auspices of the United Nations, ultimately controlled by the Zionist International Central Bankers through the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, WTO, the ECB, National Central Banks, and vast personal fortunes. The end game, and ultimate Goal is the ""New World Order"". Total control over the entire world. I have been researching this for 15 years and thousands of hours.
