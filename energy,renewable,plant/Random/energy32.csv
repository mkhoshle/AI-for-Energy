I live in the southern side of India, where it is called Kerala. Pollution here is much less compared to Delhi. But it is increasing.. it is a concern.. people need to do something... I've already decided to buy an electric car or an electric motorcycle for commuting and short trips and use petrol or diesel vehicles only for very long trips. As I am a guy who loves to drive than anything else, I cannot avoid long drives and road trips. But I've decided that all of my actions will be carbon neutral in the future. Also the thing about public transport here is, the public transport here is sometimes not comfortable or convenient.. so I think that's why some rich people have multiple cars in their home, and they always use their own vehicles to travel even for short distances. They give priority to comfort. But they have less polluting options available. It is better to convince them to use electric vehicles, or bicycles or any other less polluting means of transport.\n\n\n\nTHANK YOU AGAIN... LOTS OF LOVE FROM INDIA...

I too was once a fan, but it simply does not make sense the more you research it. The biggest problem with it, is it is very inefficient compared to battery technology. In fact hydrogen propulsion often ends up being even less efficient than internal combustion engines, which are very inefficient. Battery technology is already way better than hydrogen, and will only get better. There is also a rather insidious reason why the industry wants a hydrogen economy. It is very easy to convert fossil fuels to hydrogen. In fact, they would be able to sell hydrogen much cheaper than renewable energy sourced hydrogen, and converting energy to fuel hydrogen fuel cell cars, would only get you about a third of the distance you would get from using the same energy to operate a battery electric vehicle.",0,"3 months ago",1576786619923,false

Plus, the emissions occur in an isolated place (coal factory) instead of all over the streets and into the houses where people live. Whats more, the energy grids of the world are becoming more and more renewable energy based, so EVs are getting cleaner every year.

It is also true that the US is one of the biggest polluters in the world, especially on a per capita basis. When I look at companies like Tesla though, I feel proud of what Elon Musk is doing. I feel he is really a person of the world and something all of us can be proud of as the human race. It is countries like China and India, where populations are very concentrated, that many of the solutions will be born out of necessity. These countries will lead us all to a better way of living for all peoples, not just the obscenely wealthy.

However, I don't feel it is the fault of India for high pollution at all. It is the wasteful capitalist lifestyle which is based on disposable items, fossil fuels, and endless consumerism. While this video focused on India, I don't think it was in any way blaming India for these problems. These are social issues which affect our entire planet and as a species we need to find solutions. India does have examples of some of the most polluted cities, but you can find those also in China, and I can imagine even some severe problem areas in the US. The reason why they are so polluted though is very complex and often it is the case, like in China, where much of the other countries of the world (such as the US) are very much responsible as well. When the majority of manufacturing of US goods is in China, the people there have to live with the pollution caused by the wasteful lifestyles of people in the US. These highly wasteful and destructive lifestyle must change and there are a lot of solutions to these problems. It is going to take a shift in consciousness though, which I believe is already happening, to help transition the world to healthier symbiotic lifestyles. Even more effective though, is working to make the solutions more affordable than the more polluting alternatives.",0,"3 months ago",1576786621545,false

This means they have to pay way too much in taxes and related costs. Not to mention the humongous amounts of red tape and corruption.Venues are not properly maintained either. In one of the years, there was a bloody Vikram carrier that was driving around in the out of bounds area behind the race marshals during the F1 race at the Noida circuit. The organizers also want the races to be around Diwali so people are willing to spend more during the festival season. This makes the calender an issue too. For these factors and more, it becomes unfeasable to host major motorsport events in India.
