The largest study to date, Cook et al. (2013), attempted to categorize 11,944 abstracts [brief summaries] of papers (not entire papers) to their level of endorsement of AGW and found that 7,930 (66%) held no position on AGW, while only 64 papers (0.5%) explicitly endorsed and quantified AGW as +50% (humans are the primary cause). A later analysis by Legates et al. (2013) found there to be only 41 papers (0.3%) that supported such definition. Cook et al.'s methodology was so fatally flawed that they falsely classified skeptic papers as endorsing the 97% consensus, apparently believing to know more about the papers than their authors. The second part of Cook et al. (2013), the author self-ratings simply confirmed the worthlessness of their methodology, as they were not representative of the sample since only 4% of the authors (1,189 of 29,083) rated their own papers and, out of these, 63% disagreed with the abstract ratings. All the other ""97% consensus"" studies - e.g. Doran & Zimmerman (2009), Anderegg et al. (2010) and Oreskes (2004) - have been refuted by peer-reviews.",0,"1 month ago",1582125073235,true

It is true that summer is scorching hot, but winter is freezing cold. At least this tells us that the drastic climate change is not solely due to carbon dioxide emission. Due to the fact that the solar system is constantly shifting outwardly away from the center of the universe that subsequently leading to global cooling effect on earth where atoms have better appetite for photons. Therefore during a moonless night, the surroundings will be enveloped with complete darkness as atoms are now hungry for more photons. Air molecules that now able to stockpile more stationary photons will cause wind speeds to increase further that super hurricanes are common  occurrences. Rainfall is erratic due to the capability of stronger wind speeds to snowball clouds that some places will be inundated with excess rainfall while other places have drought. In conclusion, global cooling is already at our doorstep and we need to deal with it by planting more trees to moderate its severe effects.

We’d never heard of the greenhouse effect at that time, but we knew that a blanket of clouds (water vapor) would slow down the escape of Earth’s heat.\n\nMy dad had already flooded the ground around the trees and prepped his smudge pots to be lit at the appropriate moment (for the blanketing effect of carbon laden air).\n\nAs the thermometer continued to slowly but surely drop, we nervously sat listening to the reports on the radio. Then, just as temperatures neared freezing, a bank of clouds moved in over the region and the rate of temperature decrease slowed and stopped at 30 degrees (F.). An hour later, the sun peeked over the horizon and very slowly the temperature began to rise. Damage to the fruit and trees was avoided without having lit the smudge pots.\n\nMy point is that even though some people may not believe in the greenhouse effect, they’re almost certainly not citrus growers.\n\nSearch: \nsmudge pots infrared radiation",1,"5 months ago",1571497879194,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

They are completely unskeptical about a subject which is very obviously controversial among climate scientists and earth scientists in general. There is no such thing as a partial consensus. Consensus is total or it is not consensus. Consensus is a matter of opinion, not scientific protocol for proof. Absolute conviction in a scientist is already suspicious, but when its about a controversial subject, that discredits them utterly. 2. They want to have us all believe that the trace of a trace gas that humans contribute to is the driver for a gigantic, chaotic system with enormous forces and thousands of contributing elements. They look at the entire past and present dynamics and imagine co2 everywhere. This is not science. 3. The scientists at the IPCC were caught red handed in the early 2000s cooking the graphs to make the past temperature record colder and steady. They should all have been fired, but were never punished. When Catastrophic AGW people make claims and use materials from the IPCC, they cannot be taken seriously. 4. The Catastrophists attempt to make co2 seem toxic. Co2 is not a toxin, any more than oxygen. Co2 is as vital to life on the planet as oxygen and water. 400 ppm is already homeopathic compared to periods in the past when it was 1000s of ppm and life was flourishing. 150 ppm is the level at which all life would and has died. At 400 ppm, the current global level is LOW. 600 is common under a forest canopy. 2k to 3k on a submarine or in the space station. Co2 is pumped into actual greenhouses at 1000s of ppm because it helps with photosynth and water uptake. Without Co2 we would not be able to digest or breathe. 5. They claim that the oil companies are holding back research and are buying off their opposition. Actually, the oil industry has its head down and is funding alternative energy research and giving a lot to the IPCC. The real catastrophy is the one these snake oil salesmen would instigate if they were successful at making everyone hysterical enough to panic. Not to mention the billions they are siphoning up in tax dollars for their phony models and ridiculous prognostications, not one of which has come true. And this is the last and most damning evidence of the lie, the absolutely stunning record of failed predictions over the last 30 years. A very important aspect of any scientific theory is that it must predict effects. When the predictions fail, the theory has been disproven.",0,"7 months ago",1566227482211,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

Part of what is stated in all these videos is based on science but fewer scientists are happy with blaming human emissions than previously. Since 1850 the planet has warmed around 0.8 of 1 degree. This was since 1850 which was before the industrial revolution.  The planet has not warmed further since 1999 hence we now call it climate change instead of previously global warming. I have a pic of a Sydney light house from 100 years ago and again a pic from last year, no change in sea level around its base.  In the 1970's, scientists were afraid of another mini ice age by near the year 2000. Then out steps Al Gore who spoke of global warming. Since his dire predictions in early 2003, nothing has changed. There are still storms, tornadoes, floods etc as much as ever. Well, NASA feel they are reducing but all the media jump on any global catastrophe as if every event points to climate change.  Polar bears are increasing in number, and interestingly, green house owners in Europe deliberately pump Co2 gas into their greenhouses to massively increase yield.  Plants love Co2. Scientists say we are actually well down on Co2 gas levels compared to the Jurassic and other periods when there was much more vegetation than we have today.  Was it NASA again, who say from satellite images that areas of the planet are becoming greener as Co2 levels rise.   There was a mini ice age in the mid ages, in London the river Thames used to freeze over every winter until 1802. Since then the planet has been warming. This was before the industrial age or large amounts of human population.  And again NASA, I read a lot of what they are seeing from outer space, they say most of our planets have been warming in the last 30 years due to a solar maximum. The sun is now entering a solar minimum so we can expect a little cooling of the planet. I say, follow the money and see what these climate change folk say we should do with our countries money supplies. Handing over billions to global elites is the aim of the game here it appears and not much else. China and India give the middle finger to all this reduction of emissions.",12,"8 months ago",1563549083694,false

There's one major, glaring issue with this. Clouds.  When temperature rises, water vaporizes. Those vapors climb up to the top of the troposphere and cool down due to the rapidly dissipating atmospheric pressure and condense into clouds. 40-60% of the radiation that they block is reflected back into space, providing a damping effect on the temperature. the ACTUAL amplifier of CO2 concentration to temperature increase, therefore, is 0.5x.  2019's global temperature is EXACTLY the same as it was in 1978 when they started measuring the temperature the most accurate way that we have devised thus far, via Satellite.  prior to 1978, there were FAR warmer periods, and many other colder periods.  36 of the 37 models produced by the ""scientists"" use the parameterized inputs with the assumptions that were disproved by recent measurements taken by weather balloons in 2018.  Arctic Sea Ice is increasing in thickness, but reducing in area. Antarctic sea ice is increasing in thickness AND area. the total net change in ice volume is 80 million tons/year increase. it has been steadily rising since 1931, where it was at a far lower volume than it is right now.  The other hypothesis of the ""pause"" in ""Global Warming"" (hence the name change that same year) is that the ocean was ""consuming the heat"". that was also disproven when they sent sensors from buoys into the depths. there was observed a linear decrease in temperature relative to depth, as it was with the weather balloons' measurements when they hypothesized that there were ""hot-spots""  in the upper atmosphere, which were also disproven.  The Earth's Atmosphere is a self-balancing system and bucks the universal truth of increased entropy because of the SUN injecting 15,000X the necessary energy to maintain a constant system.",0,"1 year ago",1553008288318,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2016 it was discovered that they improperly calculated the diurnal shift and it now indicates a warming like every other temperature reconstruction.

Going from a case of lowest extent to second lowest extent isn't a recovery. Not to mention that extent isn't the same as ice volume which has certainly been on a decline.\n* Greenland is melting actually.

The only temperature reconstruction that didn't show warming was RSS which virtually every skeptic referred to and some still to this day. The only problem is that they'll refer to a 2015 version of RSS since it was discovered and verified by a skeptic that RSS which is based on satellite models for temperature had wrong values for the diurnal shift and since mid 2016 it has shown warming like every other reconstruction which uses thermometers. The great irony being that if you rely on RSS you rely on satellite models to estimate temperature and hope it's somehow more accurate than a thermometer.\n\nI also find it interesting that people still use 1998 as the start point for this claim. It was near the highest solar maximum in recent history with the strongest El Nino on record meaning that no following year should even be close to it considering the sun has been less active since then if CO2 has such a little affect on the atmosphere, yet we're still beating 1998 for record global surface temperatures with a weaker sun.",0,"1 year ago",1553008296326,true

The MWP is most clearly expressed in parts of North America, the North Atlantic and Europe and parts of Asia. For it to be global in extent the MWP would need to be seen clearly in more records from the tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. There are very few palaeoclimatic records for these latter two regions.\nOf course, if the MWP was shown to be global in extent and as warm or warmer than today (based on an equivalent coverage over the NH and SH) then obviously the late-20th century warmth would not be unprecedented. On the other hand, if the MWP was global, but was less warm that today, then current warmth would be unprecedented.\nWe know from the instrumental temperature record that the two hemispheres do not always follow one another.

My favorite of all is hemp.  For makes over 26,000 different things. we will just talk about hemp bio fossil fuel right now. 1 acre of hemp can produce, enough bile fossil fuel to fuel 10,000 vehicles for a year at about a dollar a gallon.  Hemp bio fossil fuel releases the same amount of carbon dioxide un oxygenated air) per mile as a person does when the exhale.  Versus coal oil and gas sand oil ethanol which released tens of millions of years worth of petrified death per mile.   A couple more examples! Hemp has been proven, to be 10 times stronger and 30% lighter than steel stronger and lighter than concrete stronger and lighter than brick.  Easier to work with on-site far more versatile, not to mention you could use it as much as you would like or need. Without leaving any excess toxic waste behind.  So we could rebuild America stronger later cheaper faster than any people have ever built a city town or country.  The real sales pitch.  That sold me by using Hamp!! For everything we can we will be improving and maintaining the quality of our air water food and landscapes( to groundbreaking high standards of quality)  for 1 acre of hemp! Produces 3 to 4 times the amount of oxygen as 1 acre of trees, at the same time it sucks in 3 to 4 times the amount of carbon dioxide as a acre of trees plus it rejuvenates and replenishes the soil back to Garden of paradise type quality after every harvest.  Even, if the land has been previously, stripped robbed and depleted of all its value from overharvesting things like cotton and corn.  Hemp has even been successfully grown on radiated soil.  Hemp has  the same nutritional value, as rice corn and beans wheat barley and milk.

Climate change is a real phenomenon that is slowly destroying our ecosystem. Species are dying at a rate not seen since the extinction of the dinosaurs, and we can directly correlate the rapid increase in average global temperatures to the beginning of the industrial revolution, and through decades of scientific research we have come to understand not only the causal mechanisms which are responsible for this (the greenhouse gas effect), but we are witnessing the devastating effects that this has on the ecosystem. What's more, our resource depletion alongside pollution of the atmosphere AND the rapid extinction of numerous species do not each have their own separate and individual effects, but rather they are compounded and accelerate the severity of the situation. We are also seeing chain reactions occur in the ecosystem that are going to have severe effects on our resource production and standard of living. If nothing is done, we will witness the collapse our supply chains and agricultural system, and we will starve to death. \n\n\nWe won't have to prove you and those like you wrong, the environment will do that for us when you and everyone you care about slowly starves to death.

So do not say humans are a cancer that do not deserve the Earth, but the problem is how we are living the modern life.\n\nHuman society is living with the highest standards in history, but the modern life comes with costs. Consumerism with one use products such as wrappers and boxes for the products some people take granted for creates a lot of trash. The electricity we use for all our mechanical processes are mostly created by burning fossil fuels (Renewable Energy such as solar can only do so much. . .). The Cars and computer that you use to live your modern life were created by factories that emit greenhouse gases and require the mining of resources that shift the surface.\n\nHere is the hard truth. Consumerism and the modern life is a great life, but that comes with clear costs. If you truly want to save the Earth, then understand that the human race as a whole must sacrifice many of its wants and desires and basically live with less in order to leave a smaller environmental impact. Until people figure out a way to somehow collect and recycle all the waste created by constant buying, spending, and throwing away of our trash, this is the only realistic option if we want to protect the planet in the long run.",460,"2 years ago",1521472303810,true,true,"EkQSC0c0SDFOX3lYQmlBwAEAyAEA4AEBogINKP___________wFAAMICGxoXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20iABgGMk0aSxIaVWd5dURKb2NWcUhXSFhmdHRsbDRBYUFCQWciAggAKhhVQ3BWbTdiZzZwWEtvMVByNms1a3hHOUEyC0c0SDFOX3lYQmlBQAFICg%3D%3D",55,,,,,,,,,

Also it's not just about the litter. It's also the pollution going to the air and water that's damaging the environment. The problem is there is a high demand of things for a high population and they want it for cheap! Businesses have no other choice but to commit such atrocities. Like what they do to animals in the meat industry and its effects on the environment. Or like the poisoning of water and soils with excessive herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers in agriculture. And that's only mentioning our food system. That's the problem. There's too many people in this world and few that can actually supply that population.

I am just seeing it right now for the first time and others that have commented on your comment have some truth as well.  I do like yours the best though.  I didn't read all of the comments but cutting down billions of trees also has something to do with climate change speeding up.  pretty much everything that the human race is doing and have done in the last couple of centuries is having a huge effect on our planet.  And I agree with you on the matter of humans need to take a step back in time and not be so greedy and try to live more simpler lives.  Also what people need to know is that climate change has been going on for billions of years.....  its just been speeding up.  And the global warming topic as well is silly because there is global warming and cooling, but, speeding up as well.  I believe all of mother nature is starting to get sick and tired of what we have been doing to this planet lately and is starting to fight back, and she has only just begun.  Most people think that animals are just food and plants are just for show.  What they do not know is that they are all connected.  There is a ""SOURCE"" if you will, that is the life of all plant, animal, insect, and marine life that not just feeds the entire planet but feels the negative and positive actions and reactions of all life on earth accept for humans now because over the last few hundreds of years, humans have lost connection of life.  Humans are now in the age of A.I and are on the brink of being lost forever.  That is why The powers that be are willing to take just a few humans to another planet...  lol...  But what they do not know is that it wont be the first time.  Humans were brought here a long time ago because of what they became on another planet.  It is only a matter of time before history repeats itself, and it has been repeating for biliions and billions of years and will continue to do so until.................. Picture a room with 2 doors.  One is locked and one is not.  The one that is not locked will get chosen because of the obvious.  Once through that door there is another room with another 2 doors, one which is locked and one that is not.  The one that is not locked gets chosen again, and will continue to get chosen until one finds the key and unlocks one of the door that is locked.  The funny thing is... it is always the same room and same unlocked door.  The locked door, if one chooses to unlock it, will open a path to change.  But it is not just that one.  It is the next one that decides to follow.  Think of me as crazy but it is okay.  I accepted I was crazy a very very long time ago.",2,"4 months ago",1574176305179,false

That's not the issue. Climate has been warming for centuries - since the Little Ice Age.  In 1801 Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""A change in our climate however is taking place very sensibly."" Sea level has been rising at the same rate since before the Lincoln administration. Glaciers have been receding for centuries. Greenland once was farmed. The Fertile Crescent was once fertile. \n\nOnly science deniers claim that climate change is a new phenomenon.

The rate is unprecedented, the last 3 years have seen record highs in global average temperature and the overall upward trend since 1880 has the fingerprints of greenhouse gases all over it.

They should be saying that temperatures are rising as predicted, but instead focus on tiny warming as if that was all that was predicted. Was 1937 the warmest year on record at the time? Was 1947? 1917? This is how gradual warming works: every year is, on average, the warmest on record. Means nothing other than that the climate is warming, as it has for centuries. There is no evidence of an unprecedented rate, in fact the satellite record showed 18 years of no warming at all.\n\nIf the warming had ""the fingerprints of greenhouse gases all over it,"" then the warming would have only begun in the latter half of the 20th century when atmospheric CO2 increased. It didn't. To quote Phil Jones in a 2010 BBC interview, ""This recent warming trend was no different from others we have measured. The world warmed at the same rate in 1860-1880, 1919-1940, and 1975-1998."" https://archive.fo/mlnuG/ed2f063ff371ff1dbf993c07d393dded8bb7fce2.jpg\n\nSea level rise remains unchanged:\nhttps://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=8724580 (Key West)\nhttps://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?stnid=8518750 (New York)\nhttps://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.htm?stnid=120-022 (Wismar, Germany)\nThese are just of few of the 60+ century-long tide gauges that show no increase due to CO2.",0,"2 years ago",1521472304311,false

The satellite record does not show there was ""no warming for 18 years"", it shows a record-breaking high in 1998 and steady moderate increases thereafter. If you remove the 1998 high as an anomaly, the whole ""pause"" is erased. Shame on you for repeating this denier garbage, you can't just cherry pick one favorite record high and ignore the rest of the trend.\n\nThe Hadley dataset is only made from surface-temperature readings. 95% of the sun's energy goes into the ocean, and the positive feedback from the blue Arctic as summer sea ice extent diminishes shows that the Arctic region is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet. Yet again you again attempt to obscure the bigger picture by presenting cherry-picked stats.\nhttp://metro.co.uk/2017/08/14/climate-change-warning-sign-as-arctic-is-warming-twice-as-fast-as-rest-of-planet-6850656/\n\nTide gauge measurements are not as accurate as satellite readings.

The length of the pause was calculated by going from the present backward until there was a positive trend. Before the most recent El Nino, that period was 18 years - not predicted by the models. Until Karl ""fixed"" the surface temperature history, the pause was also reflected in the Hadley and GISS datasets (which use the same weather station data). The IPCC acknowledged this.\n\nThe ""the heat went into the deep ocean"" is not plausible. The greenhouse effect operates through infrared back radiation, which will be absorbed in the first few millimeters of the ocean surface, so cannot heat the deep ocean. Greenhouse warming warms the atmosphere and then the surface. That didn't happen.\n\nDid you not read what I said? ALL the century-long tide gauges show the same thing. You're citing the same ""sea level rise doubled in 1993"" nonsense that has been debunked, even by the authors of that study. The supposed ""acceleration"" (Church & White) was a comparison between the historic rate (to the present) of coastal sea level rise from tide gauges at 1.7mm/yr, and the satellite altimeter (launched in 1993) measured global  rate of SLR at 3mm/yr. They measure two different things, not that the rate magically doubled when satellites were launched. Church and White have since walked that back, but the alarmists won't let it go. Tide gauges are both more accurate and show century-long trends, which satellites cannot do.

Imagine if in your lifetime everything in earth pretty good. And things get worse if/when you have kids so they don't have as good as you did. And things get worse if/when you have grandkids so the same thing, they don't have it as good as you or their parents. And future children's life will get worse until you die of old age and as soon as you die people will suffer and live a Mad Max life or everyone will just die a slow death. But imagine you had the ability to change that. Only if you did more than just ""enjoy the ride"" and invested in the future for the better of humanity and the results would be a perfect world where everyone and everything is free, happy, safe and sustainable wouldn't you want to change your mind and do more than ""enjoy the ride"" selfishly? In this scenario your decision ended up costing the life and lifestyle of future children and your decision inevitably was their demise. That's really unfair of you. What I'm trying to say is the future is something worth fighting and worrying for. Despite that we are all you. We can't just ""enjoy the ride"" because we have a future to look after. Yes we should enjoy and live the now and be happy we're still alive but we still have a future to look after. If our future is at stake so is our children's future and so on.

While I like other technologies better, having worked with nuclear reactors, I know most of the issues people have are from lacking knowledge about them.\n\nThe real threat comes from the consumption of animal products. The destruction of the rainforest to grow soy to feed to livestock, the trasportation of the feed and animals, and the waste is the biggest threat by far, exceeding all other contributers to global warming.

Historically, the total amount of wildfires worldwide have decreased by 15% since 1950. And the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America said that “Estimates show that even with global warming, The level of wildfires will continue to decline until mid century.” (Bjorn Lomborg, The Wall Street Journal) Also the claim that droughts have increased from global warming, is also wrong. Yes, there are places in the world where droughts became more extreme, but there are also places where droughts have become weaker. A quote from the U.N. Climate Panel 2012: “Some regions of the world have experienced more intense and longer drought, in particular in Southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions, droughts have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example in central North America and Northwestern Australia.” Furthermore, a study published by Nature in March 2014 found that globally, droughts severity has not changed thru the years. Finally, a bar graph sourced by NOAA shows that although there has been a slight increase in major Atlantic hurricanes making landfall hitting in the US, the total number of hurricanes hitting Atlantic hurricanes making landfall hitting in the US have dropped a little less than 25% of what it was in the 1950s. The sea levels are rising, but the rise is not accelerating. A paper from Global and Planetary Change found that the rate of rise has slowed down: “It is found that the GMSL rises with the rate of 3.2 ± 0.4 mm/yr during 1993–2003 and started decelerating since 2004 to a rate of 1.8 ± 0.9 mm/yr in 2012.” This shows that even with CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are accelerating, the sea levels from the oceans are not. We told that the effects of climate change is catastrophic, but that’s simply not true! We are told by people like Bill Nye that if we don't stop spewing carbon, the polar ice caps are going to completely melt and destroy numerous major cities would be flooded, but we not that this process is going to take 5000 years. ""There are more than five million cubic miles of ice on Earth, and some scientists say it would take more than 5,000 years to melt it all."" National Geographic. Policies are being pushed like the end of the world is coming in 100 years. All this shows that we shouldn't be freaking out because it’s simply not necessary.",2,"1 year ago",1553008307588,false

You are providing information from a website who's while purpose is to deny climate change so the information is 100% biased and skewed. Also from your source\n ""Crucially, GEOCARB has a 10 million year timestep, leading Berner to explicitly advise against using his model to estimate Late Ordovician CO2 levels due its inability to account for short-term CO2 fluctuations. He noted that exact values of CO2... should not be taken literally. ""\n\n 2. Yes during the half billion years, planetary temperatures alternated between extended cold snaps with low CO2 levels, and intense “greenhouse” temperatures at which CO2 levels rose to 3,000 ppm. Due to nuclear reactions in stars, like our Sun, over time they become brighter.  Meaning that, although carbon dioxide concentrations were high hundreds of millions of years ago, the net warming effect of CO2 and sunlight was less. On average  co2 levels gradually declined over time by about 3-4 ppm per million years. So the coincidence of a greenhouse atmosphere and a cooler Sun created conditions in which life emerged, evolved and adapted to its environment. Plants consumed and sequestered carbon dioxide, and animals benefited from the oxygen released in the process. Planetary temperatures began to stabilise – until humans launched the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s. The world’s nations, meeting at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, pledged to cut fossil fuel use and contain global warming to a maximum of 2°C.\n\nReleasing fossil fuels back into the atmosphere would mean that, by 2250, CO2 levels would reach 2,000 ppm. This has not been seen for 200 million years. So not only will the resultant climate change be faster than anything the Earth has seen for millions of years, the climate that will exist is likely to have no natural counterpart. \n\nSince 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the sun either remained constant or increased slightly. If the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.",3,"2 years ago",1521472308474,false
