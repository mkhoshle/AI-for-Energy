However, the Chinese government has adopted very tough measures to limit the emissions of factories, and even made some small factories fail because they cannot effectively control their emissions and cannot pass environmental protection assessments. In addition, the Chinese government also mandates that companies in China must purchase labor insurance for employees, so in recent years China's industrial costs have gradually increased. Some foreign companies, even Chinese companies themselves, will consider setting up factories in Southeast Asian countries with lower costs. However, China has a complete industrial system, which is still China's advantage over Southeast Asian countries.\nRegarding Beijing's pollution situation, it is actually due to Beijing's geographical environment and historical reasons. . .

Considering most asian civilizations already were quite embedded in nature when compared to the west , even historically.\n\n The industrial revolution in Europe and U.S, did cause alot of environmental harm, the buring and colonization of the north American continent too result in massive imbalances for the region along with a "" dust bowl"". Which when compared to the shorter industrialization of some asian nations, who skipped most of the more polluting technologies due to history, is far less and well they do reserve the rights to modernize.  \n\nTh west has done countless nuclear tests, in air, land and sea....even space. Recently Nasa made alot of noise when India tested its ASAT missle, hilarious considering most of the space junk around in earth's orbit today is US generated. Even wars, in a modern world where the west pretends to be so ""civic"" and be the flag bearers of ""peace"", "" justice"" and ""morals"", they end up fighting wars and draining the resources of said land, in the name kf foreign policy? While shying away from the debt owed by the west to the world?\n\nSome other subtle but drastic environmental challenges can be traced back to colonial era where the introduction and persistence of certaim crops for profit of the west led to infertile soil and migration and death of many. \n\nSo while it may not be true that the west is to be entirely held responsible, both in moralistic and nominal terms, for the fight against global warming, it is entirely true, and a fact that the west should do alot more, not only because history asks them to, but because, they are probably in the best place to either directly or indirectly help bring in a huge change moving forward.",5,"3 weeks ago",1582834728650,false

Global greening is mainly caused by increased C02 in the atmosphere. The population of India grows by 20 million every year - to put that into context, that's an extra New Delhi's worth of people every year - or the equivalent of the total populations of New Zealand, Portugal and Ireland .... every year!  If an hypothetical civil war raged in India that had the same monthly casualty rate as WW2 and WW1 (combined) - the population of India would still have an annual increase despite the death toll.

Cross check with Wikipedia or Britannica encyclopedia. \nIt's not a Chinese controlled media outlet. Journalists publish without having to submit their work for fact check by anyone whosoever or for any form of control for that matter (ie the so called freedom of expression). Even if it is a Hongkong news outlet, the journalist can publish and will publish anti China articles as you have seen on the Hongkong riots. They show us police officers using force to defend themselves as an example of police brutality. Yet nobody was even killed. Yet in India, they refrain from using the term police brutality when clashes have ended up with rioters and police dead. Check out the riots reported in India. Did the South China morning Post report about police brutality as much as in Hong Kong despite more than 30 deaths over the past 4 months ? Those journalists don't just think about the truth about what should be reported, they also, if not, certainly look at where the funding is coming.

But due to lake a freedom at least the government did something for the planet. If you life in a democracy you will have too many people arguing with eachother till they choose a solution. China again has a communist party and India has this hirachy system that has probably a big affect in politics. Of course if some tyrant which only thinks about himself gets the power every thing goes down and if not it has the potential to bring or more like force people together to do amazing things. Con and pro of idk a big group with one mindset i guess. \n\nLooking at democracy and capitalist countries which mainly wants profit.\nBut not against it fully.
