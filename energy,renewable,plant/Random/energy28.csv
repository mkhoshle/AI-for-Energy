By bringing down the energy costs, India is basically reinventing the entire power consumption paradigm. China‚Äôs dependence on coal and oil means it is going to be forever beholden to international movements. I wonder if India can have 60-70% of its energy mix in solar - it will become a country that will completely change the global power dynamics shift as no international trade sanctions or oil prices can ever impact India. It maybe even that as fossil fuel sources run out, the only places in the world that survive are tropical regions and colder climate regions having to buy energy from these tropical countries completely upending the global power dynamics. The only challenge I see is the usual Indian penchant for corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, populist policies etc derailing its mission as in the past where so many of India‚Äôs big thinking missions have only partially succeeded. Energy independence is a huge thing in today‚Äôs world and India has an amazing opportunity.

Like India, Chinese cities also topped the top 10 most polluted cities in the world a few years ago, now none of Chinese cities are to be found anywhere on top 20 list. One single hydroplant, The Gorges Dam, alone is already providing 60 million people electricity in excess, so these people literally don't need to use any other kinds of electricity. Well talk about coal usage, haha the Americans are consuming it 3x more per capita compared to Chinese individuals, and there is a reason for the poor countries to consume coal in the first place, because it is way cheaper than other types of electricity. Ever seen the single solar plant farm in China which could essentially support the whole UK electricity consumption. One way to see if this is true is simply by looking at the pollution level, which is directly reflecting to your electricity plans. Ofc you could say that India has a smaller landmass and huge population, but if in that case, china should not be that far ahead of them either, people are densely urbanized in the coastline, but it doesn't seem like the case, because China is undoubtedly doing it better, which is pretty natural since Indian economy is only 1/4 of China.",1,"5 months ago",1571512743792,false

Now I see the with a tiny solar panel and an LED bulb which actually work all night and turns off automatically in the morning. Heavy vehicles will use fossil fuels. But look around you. How many heavy vehicles do you see for every car or bike on a street. Military vehicles will use fossil fuels. How many vehicles do a country own in comparison to the vehicles owned by citizens in the same country. I will come back to heavy vehicles. I have seen quite a few prototypes for big trucks ( aka lorries) that will run on electric. Yes, these will be short distance commuters. However, if you know anything about trucking/ transportation industry, you will the percentage of short distance commuters are much higher percentage than long distance ones. Trains and ships move the bulk. And wait for Hyper loop one.. If that become a reality... Would be interesting to watch the goods movement.

NOT AT ALL! I see 1000s of cars being driven with lone person in it, when  actually  it could have given 'FREE RIDE ' to 4 more passengers! Why don't we have  cars for  individuals ONLY (not bikes). Cars only for 1 rider would have been much more efficient vehicles than 5 seater cars.\nIn an efficient today's world , there's still room to enhance efficiency. \nWorld natural resources are stagnant but population growth is massive, how do you cater to it?\nThe NEW GREEN DEAL alone cannot help",0,"5 months ago",1571512744309,false

There is nothing called a perfect situation. If you exhale you are polluting this planet. Yes. Fossil fuels will be used. No stopping it. But reduction will happen. Solar panels created a certain amount of pollution as part of manufacturing and once their life ends. However, once they are recycled, the effects will be minimal. Vehicles will run on streets and people will use it. However, better products that could be recycled more efficiently will be created. Takes time.. but will happen. The phone/ tablet / PC or whatever you used to read/comment is by far more polluting than a car/bike/bus one use to travel. It is not just the equipment. It is the infrastructure. You go to a hospital?.. You eat? Wear clothes? Go to school? Polluting by 100 different ways everyday. Answer is not stop. Answer is minimize, recreate, research new products, that creates least impact.",0,"5 months ago",1571512744311,false
