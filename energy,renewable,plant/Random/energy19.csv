I am all in for large scale forestation projects to green up areas that have been affected by de-forestation and desertification. Carbon dioxide levels are too low at the moment and should be increased especially if large scale forestation projects are undertaken.

E and V are like chalk and cheese, literally!  Unlike the inorganic CO2 on Venus The carbon on earth is mostly organic. She conveniently forgets to tell you 1) that¬†Earth rotates in about 24 hours whereas Venus rotates in the contrary sense taking 243 days. 2) Both planets have almost the same size and density but¬†Venus¬†is 30% closer to the Sun than¬†Earth. 3) Venus atmosphere is 100x denser than earth. Chalk and cheese indeed!!¬†¬†4) There is virtually no water on Venus\n Ours is a unique planet having at least 32 ""fine-tuned"" parameters that make it life supporting. It is 2/3 covered by water and much of the land mass is covered by forests and plants. Having an atmosphere containing O2 at 20% and CO2 at 0.04% the carbon cycle is uniquely balanced to support all carbon based lifeforms including the young lady!!  Anyone with half brain could do an experiment to subject a large rock to heat for 200days and compare with the same heat applied to a tree or pond of water for one day to see which is more capable of dissipating large amounts of heat. I doubt whether any of these serial activists have any idea that water vapor is 8x more effective as a greenhouse gas than CO2. \nMoreover there is ample evidence to suggest increasing our atmospheric CO2 from 1 part in 2500 (0.04%) to  1.5 in 2500 (0.06%) will do no more  than double crop yields as numerous greenhouse experiments have shown.",0,"5 months ago",1571506736617,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,

E and V are like chalk and cheese, literally!  Unlike the inorganic CO2 on Venus The carbon on earth is mostly organic. She conveniently forgets to tell you 1) that Earth rotates in about 24 hours whereas Venus rotates in the contrary sense taking 243 days. 2) Both planets have almost the same size and density but Venus is 30% closer to the Sun than Earth. 3) Venus atmosphere is 100x denser than earth. Chalk and cheese indeed!!  4) There is virtually no water on Venus\r\n Ours is a unique planet having at least 32 ""fine-tuned"" parameters that make it life supporting. It is 2/3 covered by water and much of the land mass is covered by forests and plants. Having an atmosphere containing O2 at 20% and CO2 at 0.04% the carbon cycle is uniquely balanced to support all carbon based lifeforms including the young lady!!  Anyone with half brain could do an experiment to subject a large rock to heat for 200days and compare with the same heat applied to a tree or pond of water for one day to see which is more capable of dissipating large amounts of heat. I doubt whether any of these serial activists have any idea that water vapor is 8x more effective as a greenhouse gas than CO2. \r\nMoreover there is ample evidence to suggest increasing our atmospheric CO2 from 1 part in 2500 (0.04%) to  1.5 in 2500 (0.06%) will do no more  than double crop yields as numerous greenhouse experiments have shown.",1,"5 months ago",1571506748227,false

Right off the bat, she makes the erroneous claim that Venus and Earth receive essentially the same amount of solar energy. I would not say that 2 is ""essentially equal to"" 1. Not even close. And Venus does receive nearly twice the solar irradiance as does Earth.\n\nEssentially the same amount of carbon? That's also debatable. Most of the carbon on early Earth may well have been in our atmosphere. What is now oxygen (21% of the atmosphere) was previously CO2. Even before photosynthesis on Earth, Venus had some 420 times the CO2 that existed in Earth's atmosphere. Currently, that ratio is 220,000:1.\n\nAt any concentration below 4,000 ppm, CO2 remains an extremely weak greenhouse gas. We saw this with the global cooling during the 1940 to 1970 period when global cooling made the headlines with threats of a new ""Ice Age,"" all while the world was pumping out tons more CO2 from WW2 to post-war industrialization.\n\nWe live in an Ice Age! Those 2 little white things at the poles prove that, yet people still are under the delusion that our current interglacial -- the Holocene -- is not like the other interglacials of the current Ice Age. Global Warming is a good thing, up to the complete melting of all polar ice, and beyond at least up to +20C warmer global average climate. The last time it got that warm, during the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum, with CO2 at 4,000 ppm, for 14 million years, we did not have runaway greenhouse warming.

She also (correctly) said that even Mercury is cooler than Venus (even the dayside), despite being closer. That's because temperature drops off fairly slowly as you move away from the star. In fact, Venus absorbs less sunlight than Earth because it is very cloudy and very bright, and so most solar energy is reflected back to space.",8,"3 years ago",1489945157665,false

The point is that carbon in the atmosphere undeniably leads to increased temperatures in the planet. UNDENIABLY. and it was an opener to my general case that we need to make a global effort to stop injecting our atmosphere with carbon, so that any arguments that hinted that carbon emissions are not ultimately dangerous for us as a species would be eliminated from the discussion.

There are numerous factors at work that determine WHY (a question so many Leftists are loathe to consider in any situation) there is so much CO2 in Venus' atmosphere. In order to achieve something like that here on Earth with our plate tectonics, different geologic composition, and, yes, further distance from the sun, we'd need to get our CO2 PPM up around a staggering 30,000. To do that we'd need to burn, without ever developing mitigating technolgies, many many times more fossil fuels than exist on our entire planet.\n\nSo, should we less fossil fuels, contribute less CO2 and support alternate technolgies if we have the means to do so? Certainly.

Somebody says ""Climate Change is real"". My mind immediately thinks what in the world does that even mean. The person has not specified whether they are talking about a man made catastrophic global warming or some moderate warming and that makes all the difference. There is no man made catastrophic global warming. Then the person starts talking about conspiracies. My mind immediately starts to ask what conspiracies are they talking about because they haven't referenced any and neither have I. My mind will then immediately recognize they are trying to bring in another logical fallacy this one not being equivocation and/or conflation, but a sort of straw man argument. I can also apply critical thinking to your last argument about fossil fuels being finite. I first ask, OK, but isn't everything finite, yes. Also, why should we use something inferior like unreliables just because we could supposedly use them forever? The answer is we shouldn't. Also, what about the claim that they are infinite? Well, it doesn't take much critical thinking to realize that while the wind and the sun may be relatively infinite, the materials used to catch them are not, such as rare earth metals, or that you would have to spread them all of the earth, or that the energy is expensive, dilute and intermittent which is why they are called  unreliable in the first place. My mind then asks, why would a person make so many obvious dishonest and/or logical errors and the reason is they are trying to advocate an ideology which is not based on reality. They are advocating some political ideology like anti-capitalism in one form or another which is manifest in such examples as Environmentalism, which is a particularly evil religion. There are two main arguments today against Capitalism. The first is the Climate Change argument and the second is the inequality argument. Thankfully Yaron Brook and Alex Epstein have now written the books ""The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels"" and ""Equal is unfair"", respectively, to address these arguments.",1,"3 years ago",1489945158443,false

It is so obvious I see right through these rationalizations. Also, many will tell you straight out that it is really about being anti-capitalism. Have you not heard of the book: Capitalism vs. Climate Change by Naomi Klein? It is so foolish that people think I can't see through this nonsense. Also, again you talk about authority (some 97% god figure that only you can see) rather than reality. This 97% thing doesn't exist and you can't even define it and even if it did that is authority, not reality. I don't want an authority telling me to believe in something (which is what you do), I want a reason, because reason is my means of knowledge, not faith, which is what comes from authority.
