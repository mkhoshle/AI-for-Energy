Once the privatization aspect is cut out of the picture, there's no reason why the material capital for solar can't been worked for within a year or two. That means no energy / fuel bills whatsoever once public ownership is gained of the industries that produce renewable energy equipment. I think that's clearly a policy that will win major public support; now consider who is voting against it. Who is voting to make people unnecessarily pay for energy and who wants the payments? Aside from the huge bills, putting more than ten percent of people in energy poverty and many more struggling and worrying and constantly juggling finances to just about cope, how much in tax subsidies (public debt) are they claiming? What is the Real Cost of them poisoning the environment and everything dependent upon it? Are their lies about the known effects of their dirty business crimes against humanity? Should the people who 'work respectable jobs' in firms like these be allowed legal protection by the criminal corporation known as city of london, the wide-open 'secret city' within the City of London favoured for its crippling libel so-called laws (legal red tape based on hiding transnational corporate crimes)? https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/05/reputation-laundering-is-lucrative-business-for-london-pr-firms",5,"2 years ago",1521471964919,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,
