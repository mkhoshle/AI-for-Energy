We are still developing economy, which means we are going to have large and quick industrial development, which will bring pollution. This have happened in Europe, but they already gotten pass the point.\n\n2. Too many population. If you look at pollution/carbon emission per capita, China and India both rank a lot lower than developed countries such as the US, but we have 4-5 times the population concentrated in a few metropolitan areas. This is also another problem that can't be fixed in the next 10 or even 100 years. \n\n3. Still too many population, but this time the population also causes problem when the government trying to enact some sort of law to control the pollution. Environmental laws are usually enacted in the expense of having to shut down factories, slowing down economic development---reduce carbon emission, but many people will lose their jobs and their livings or be greatly affected by it.\n\nIn conclusion, we are trying our best to fight the problem, BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOT GOING TOBE FIXED JUST BY SOME RANDOM KID BITCHING ABOUT IT IN THE COMMENT SECTION.",1,"8 months ago",1563548971337,true,true,"EkQSC1l4N0FyMjFfUTFJwAEAyAEA4AEBogINKP___________wFAAMICGxoXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20iABgGMk0aSxIaVWd4bUJack1ndXVjX1Y3cHZESjRBYUFCQWciAggAKhhVQ0s3dHB0VURIaC1SWURzZHhPMS01UVEyC1l4N0FyMjFfUTFJQAFICg%3D%3D",1,,,,,,,,,

China do not have support from anyone but themselves, understandable the country is not democratic but the government still put in huge efforts to make the economy grow In such little time. China houses large hub cities, filled with life, business and breathtaking infrastructure all in little time. China rebuilt their country, although they do need improvements on human rights, religious rights etc they generally have excellent living standards. Being korean chinese, majority of China‚Äôs residents are happy and I have seen little to no poverty stricken people. Everyone has some sort of work, whether that be farmer or factory worker or more obviously modern jobs office workers, shopkeepers etc . China had no support from anyone, and now they support others like Africa, regardless of those colonisation accusation. The British colonised, Hong Kong, the Portuguese Macau, but look at these cities when they were returned to the chinese! Massive successful shopping, tourist trader marketing hub. India must look upon itself and improve. India and China had similar difficulties but the mentality is different, and we now see who is more successful. China. So India can definitely improve if China did. But India must see and solve their problems instead of blaming on other people. You don‚Äôt become a super power and make decisions until your country is proud and whole.

I have never seen any other country like that. Also it was india who gave birth to 4 major religions like Hinduism Buddhism Sikhism and Jainism.

Itsvery difficult for any country's government to maintain a population of 1.2 billion.
