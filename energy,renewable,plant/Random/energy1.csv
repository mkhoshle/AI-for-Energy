If Africa is China's China,  than India is probably going to be Africa's Africa.  For that to happen,  Africa needs a few more years, about 7- 10 years..  If your in doubt, consider all three of these locations have a billion population.  Why U ask this may happen??  Africa after taking humongous loans from China needs a something to hold back China, n a strong India n Africa 2 billion people will over come China's 1 billion people both in economic n military..  So a strong India, will be beneficial for a continental Africa that is in debted to China.  Throughout, history its always been a balance of power or gaining leveler-age over another group..  For example for the last decades, the USA took leverage over Europe right after WW II,  then both USA n Europe started taking leverage over the rest of the world.  Then Japan, Korea join n now China join.  Almost every nation that reaches a level of prosperity try to put leverage over others that isn't up to their level, whether by economic power, prestige or by military. Even Saudi did that to their lesser  rich Arab neighbors n fellow Muslim nations.  Did they help Egypt or other nations to reach their prosperity, no.  They try to take advantage.  Look at all the Bengali Muslims that work for them n how they are treated unfairly economically in Saudi Arabia.",0,"4 months ago",1574174675721,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,

The British PM Winston Churchill one of the Greatest Statesman decided not to argue with fools and told Nehru &  Gandhi, we are ready to get out you can takes over ASAP. After August 15th 1947, the India Rupee all its value in the market. One Pound was 12 Silver Rupees and US dollar was 13 Silver Rupee.  Today Indian Rupee has scrap value and the Indian Paper money is worthless outside of India.  Had India remained with Britain, today would have been number one super economic power. What did the Indian leader do wrong? Nehru & Gandhi did not know (learned) the art of negotiation. In business and in politics you have to negotiate. Not tell ""Get out ASAP.""

This is not bramhavidya. Try learning our language. You have museums right, they're not museums . Do you know about dhongala bazaar I mean thief's market. Your country is still earning something on that. Your queen still wearing a diamond  of my muddy land. You behave like you are proud of your ancestries thefts. Not just theft, they had cut the thumbs of wavers and demolished all the weaving equipment. Killed millions of people without reason. I think you can never have beautiful talks like we use to have with our families, neighbours and everyone. Money doesn't decide whether a country or a person is happy. Go to indian slums  you'll be ashamed of your behaviour after seeing those beautiful and heart ful smiles of poor people. I am sure you never would have such beautiful relationships with people. I am 19 and no boy except for my brother even touched me till day. Your country people can sleep with anyone and marry someother, as someone said no difference with prostitution. Sacred sex was performed on roads. And you call we indians are looking dirty and live in dirt. Atleast our bodies are pure check out hour's once. Shameless came here supporting your cruel ancestors. I don't think your's a happy country. If you are happy why should you come to look into this video related to India. You know my mom stays beside me till I die and my heart lives damn happy in that one reason. You guys doesn't even think of relations and always run for money . Money is not happiness wake-up. But you can't. You'll die never in peace. Atleast you'll face one of the attrocities of one of my ancestors faced due to British. Atleast our bodies and brains are pure which is opposite to you. Only your land is looking rich due to the looted money. But your character spoke louder about your cleanliness. I pity that you are living in this muddy planet as you don't wish to step on mud. Go show your shitty face to sun he'll turn your purpura looking face into a bit tan beautiful face. And do meditation daily so that your inclusiveness atleast build up to 1 percent. Remember INDIA is known for it's inclusiveness and just that will take to divine heights. Better you die before seeing India regaining her richness otherwise you'll die in regret.

That's your Perception that there is only dust in India. India completely isn't a slum. There are many sides of India. I live in Tirupati . Come here and then say if there is dust here. Ever you spent your time in paddy fields taking fresh air. We are always taking it. Change the way how you look at poor if you are not intended to help them in any kind of way. Hope you realise what's VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM of my religion. It says entire world is your family. We believe in that. If you wanna believe go and help them for atleast some extent. And we are really happy here in this greenery between the hills. I don't need your concern in words. If you are damn concerned go to slums of India and develop them. If you ain't then leave thinking about India. I told you to use Google translator coz that last lines I wrote were of telugu language. You may read it but couldn't understand. You wanna proof , entire world knows it. Come and visit indian palaces, royal temples. Go to Britain's museum. Our people are damn rich then. It's fact that they looted us. If you wanna condemn do it to yourself coz your textbooks are showing false history to you. If you know everything you'll be ashamed of what your ancestors did. They're not human but demon under human skin. Don't behave like them. If I were in your place, I would have said read well, do good job and help your country. But, you are older than me and still brain is immatured. I don't know whether there's heart or not. Leave the topic it's best thing. If you wanna see that divine heights stay alive until then.

See india was called the golden bird . From the time of the grecian empires to alexander to mughals to the portugese the dutch the french and finally your favorite the british all invaded india throughout its history. Everytime a war came pretty much the whole kingdom suffered. If their ruling king won , its great people celebrated. If ruling king lost, mass murdur rape looting of anything the eye can see. Before a new kingdom could be established and peace could be restored another greedy king with lust for all things valuable would come with his fleet. So india was constantly plundered by various etnicities and religions. Thr thing was some of them were tolarent and some werent. Take the case of akbar the great . He was tolarent to all religions of his subjects, married a hindu princess and built a temple for her in his palace , even invented his own religion deen e ilahi meaning all religions are one. Now take the case of his descendent aurangazeb. He was austere not greedy. But was maliciously religious. He could not tolarate any othee religion other than islam. He hated hindus so much so that he ordered destruction of a temple got the idols out and used them to make steps for his masjid. Due to his religios fanatism his kingdom suffered and by the time the last of the mughal descendents came to power the mughal empire shrunk more than half its size. But when british touched the shores of calicut india in the 17th centuary they came on the pretext of buissiness and trade unlike their predecessors who came on horse backs as plunderers. They slowly infiltrated the indian society pitting one king against the other and before anyone could realise east india companupy became the british empire, the business man became the master the white man the gore sahib. They attacked the regional kingdoms and plundered what they could find and they would export all of that wealth to england . The kingdom where sun never sets climbed such enthralling heights because of the plundering of india. The irony was that the british used our crop our money our wealth and in return called us beastly people with beastly religion. Mind you these are the words of the great winston churchill. He said indians know only to breed like rabbits and worship their unneccesarily merciless religion. Charles dickens in his letters expressed a strong desire for the indian race to be wiped out of the face of the planet. The great bengal famine wws a result of diversion of food from bengal where millions starved to the wartime stocks meant for assumed consumption of burly greek men. And when concerened and gult conciouss officals asked churchill he simply said why hasnt gandhi died yet?. So basically by the time 2nd world war ended britan used india to the fullest extent . There was no furthur use so they left, they left by making the once richest country on this planet bankrupt and on its knees with a refugee crisis and a migration crisis that left millions dead or displaced. Japan was only bombed in 2 cities hiroshima and nagasaki. Remember that japan was an axis country with an ambition to capture all of asia, no one did it to them. No one drained them of their resources . China was never under british rule or for that matter any colonization.. chinas economy sprung only a couple decades ago... also what western media shows about india is completly bogus. We are all not beggars we all dont live in one big slum we all dont drink cow piss. India has 5 major religions . One of then is hinduism . India is not a hindu country its a secular one. We started cleaning up the mess that british left us . Its a work in progress, india in general can be described as work in progress. If you wont believe me do check out britan does owe reparations by an indian mp dr shashi tharoor. Ready to be mind blown.

But that side of the story is told far too many times. In those beautiful buildings of calcutta and bombay no brown man or brown woman was allowed. We lived like slaves in our own country. In those railways that the british built the indian man was alllowed to only sit in 3rd class as the first 2 classes were for the great white man.in the schools that the great british built?. Only the creamy layer of rich indians and feudal prince and princesses were allowed to study along with british kids. Where i am from, andhra pradesh in india we have seen far too much. My grandparents remember the oppresssion. The british along with the regional nizam kings destroyed the region. When a brit or a nizam came our way all of the village had to sit on its knees and touch his head to the ground as a mark of respect. No matter what their age is or their proffesion is. I think the one good thing the brits gave us was not the railways or the bulidings or the english language. Because of their atrocities everyone united, the hindus the muslims the sikhs the christians. At the end of the independance struggle , a persons identity was not his religion or his birth , it was his country. It was bharatiya , indian. As for breeding like rabbits?? According to indian  texts there are 8 wealths a person can have . Those are health, wealth, happiness,bravery , children, food grains etc. Children were considered godgiven back in the day. Thanks to the arrival of british they bought with them a wide array of diseases like small pocks and bubonic plague. Such was the state that if you had 10 children chances were that only 3 or 4 would survive. So people started ""breeding like rabbits"" so that their bloodline will go forward. Indians have a weird obsession with taking their bloodline forward. Let me give you an example , my grand fathers fathers fatherhad 2 wives because his first wife died he married another woman . He had in total 10 children. My great grandfather had 8 children . My grandfather had 2 children and my mother has 2 . No body in todays day and time has 10 children. The rate of family planning and vasectomy has increased . Female infanticide does happen but only in remote village areas . I am a female too. Nobody opresses me, my voice is heard. Female oppression does happen in india but agin most of it is from the rural areas. Townsfolk and urban people do not do it. As for happiness in india? Indians are unhappy. Hell most of my cousins are depressed or heading their way to a midlife crisis . You know why? Not because they are forced to a marriage or forced to leave their jobs. Indian parents especially the south indian ones force their kids to take up engineering or medicine. In the south if you are 15 years old, people will not ask you how are you? Or what are you planning to do with your life, they ask beta engineer or doctor? So obviosly many take up professions they dont like and end up depressed. That is the reason for so many suicides in india .indian schools are collages are not places of teaching and education. They are factories churning out engineers and doctors. You know we read 12th class syllabus in 8th class because it will be easier to crack medical entrances? Our school day starts at 8 and ends at 7 in the evening. It is hell. Hopefully indian parents will change their mindset. I love the way finland functions . Finlands education system is the best in the world. Hopefully india will finally realise that their way of teaching is old and rotten and take up better ways of teaching . Bbc surely shows india to the the hell on earth no wonder the world hates us and our practices. You have to come here to see what it is. You will see a remote south indian state which is extremly well kept than northindian cities. I know that all my attempts are futile in changing the view but any try is not a small try.

The obession with engineering and medicine is because indian parents what their kids to ""settle""in life. Meaning they should start earning at the age of 24 or 25 and get married and start a family. No chance to explore the world or explore themselves. As soon as a child is born , parents tell their relatives that an engineer is born or a doctor is born. They push us to study trignometry and calculus from 6th standard . Most of our schools dont have leisure or pt periods because they think it is a ""waste of time"". Most indian kids do join an engineering or med school but lack confidance. They will not have any spoken skills or hobbies. It sucks.

Let me clear this point.Islam is a peaceful religion.The very word is derived from Arabic word silm which means peace.The Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) taught peace and peaceful co-existence.The whole teachings of Quran and the Life of the Prophet stand testimony to this fact.Many people  wrongfully attribute terrorism and violence to Islam,because they have not studied the teachings of Islam comprehensively.They do not understand the spirit of those teachings.Today,Islamophobia is a big threat to global peace and peaceful co-existence.It is time to address this issue by promoting the TRUE TEACHINGS of Islam.No one should be allowed to misinterpret an ideology.There is a verse in Chapter al-Maidah in the Holy Quran which says ""Whoever kills a human being,for  other than murder or spreading mischief in the land,it shall be as if he had killed the entire humanity.And if anyone saves one life it shall be as if he has saved the life of all humanity""...Regards",0,"3 months ago",1576766696108,false

I want to point out that Islam is not as great as you talk about - the reason being Prophet Mohammed himself was involved in wars. The entire religion of zoroastrianism of pre Islamic middle east was wiped out and their religious places got converted into mosques. The true teachings of Islam does have some violence in it, as why does all misinterpretation of religion only ever happen with Islam and no other religion ?

All the articles I read on it talk about that religion being eliminated by being forced to convert by the Arabs. Their fire temples all got converted to mosques that not even one survives to this day.

The economy was then characterised by extensive regulation, protectionism, public ownership of large monopolies, pervasive corruption and slow growth.[56][57][58] Since 1991, continuing economic liberalisation has moved the country towards a market-based economy.[56][57] By 2008, India had established itself as one of the world's faster-growing economies.\n\nAncient and medieval eras\n\nIndus Valley Civilisation\n\nThe citizens of the Indus Valley Civilisation, a permanent settlement that flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, practised agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well-planned streets, a drainage system and water supply reveals their knowledge of urban planning, which included the first-known urban sanitation systems and the existence of a form of municipal government.[59]\n\nFor a continuous duration of nearly 1700 years from the year 1 AD, India is the top most economy constituting 35 to 40% of world GDP.[60]\n\nWest Coast\n\nMaritime trade was carried out extensively between South India and Southeast and West Asia from early times until around the fourteenth century AD. Both the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts were the sites of important trading centres from as early as the first century BC, used for import and export as well as transit points between the Mediterranean region and southeast Asia.[61] Over time, traders organised themselves into associations which received state patronage. Historians Tapan Raychaudhuri and Irfan Habibclaim this state patronage for overseas trade came to an end by the thirteenth century AD, when it was largely taken over by the local Parsi, Jewish, Syrian Christian and Muslim communities, initially on the Malabar and subsequently on the Coromandel coast.[62]\n\nSilk Route\n\nOther scholars suggest trading from India to West Asia and Eastern Europe was active between the 14th and 18th centuries.[63][64][65] During this period, Indian traders settled in Surakhani, a suburb of greater Baku, Azerbaijan. These traders built a Hindu temple, which suggests commerce was active and prosperous for Indians by the 17th century.[66][67][68][69]\n\nFurther north, the Saurashtra and Bengal coasts played an important role in maritime trade, and the Gangetic plains and the Indus valley housed several centres of river-borne commerce. Most overland trade was carried out via the Khyber Passconnecting the Punjab region with Afghanistan and onward to the Middle East and Central Asia.[70]Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins, barter was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while their craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services.[71]",0,"11 months ago",1555685113249,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

The bureaucracy of india is lazy, doesn't participate in nations development but rather thinks of its own profit. Some people are trying to change, but think that India has small area and has to sustain the population of 1.3 billion which is still increasing. Good thing for China is that the area is more hence the population is sparse, helping in economy and development. I strongly believe that India should ban more than 2 births.\n\nBtw China government doesn't support I Dia because it's pressurized due to Pakistan.

Ignore these other dumbfucks in this comment section who are hindu shiv sena nationlists and hate religious minorities such as Sikhs,buddhists Christians and muslims. Im an American Sikh with family roots on both sides of the Panjab, alot of pakistanis are great people , hats off to Imran Khan for building Kartarpur Gurdwara corridor for Sikhs!!! We love this very much and all the gurdwaras in pakistan are top notch. India backed out of kartarpur because they dont like the Sikhs. Never forget Sikh Genocide 1984 where Indian brahmin goverment both bjp,congress killing 30,000+ innocent sikhs and raped and pillaged. Visit ensaaf.org to see even real proof about missing human rights cases in punjab. THe british fucked everything apart for our two nations, During Sikh Raj rule of maharaja ranjit singh, Literacy rates for muslims was 80%!!!! after british left it was like 20%, there was equal rights for women and all religion during Sikh kingdom rule! Hindu nationalist will try to potray Sikhs as a anti muslim religion when in fact we were always suppose to be indepdent nation and rule, we fought against corrupt hindu pahari rajas and muslim pathans fought for our side to help us and our golden temple the first foundation brick was laid down by a muslim man! We have texts of sufi muslim saints in our Shri GURU Granth Sahib by baba Farid!! Please visit Basics of Sikhi youtube channel to learn alot more I really want you to least learn about it with history you will love it! Peace and love for our nations, Sikh Referendum 2020 is coming with huge support. We will have peace between our 3 nations ignore the dumbwits RSS shiv sena in the comments they have no heart and always hate on pakistan when pakistanis these days are very liberal and open minded!

The Chinese are forever indebted to the Indians as they have learned a lot from the Indians over the thousands of years, but Indians haven't learned much from the Chinese.   For example, India chose Democracy which is a system that is bound for failure.   While Communists seek social justice and social good for all, Democracies seek instant gratification of the individuals with total disregard for others.   Democracies inevitably fail into mob rule, anarchy, and lawlessness, as it happened in Athens 2500 years ago, as correctly predicted by Socrates, as it is happening in USA today.   Corruption and the caste system are also some of the ills in India.   In China, the country had gone through the Cultural Revolution and cleaned up these kind of superstitions.   Learn Chinese.

Venezuela has been raped through and through by these American motherfuckers, and that is why it is in such a poor shape.

Demonetization and GST are both very strong policies. India only needed one of them but god knows why modi implemented both GST would have been enough to tackle up with the black money but combining it with demonetization was the worse decision.  Both of these policies will have negative effects in short term or present as they'll be new to market but with time market will adjust itself with the policies and these will show amazing results in long run. Example of this is Ludhiana City in punjab which is also known as the Manchester of India( its a business city 5th wealthiest in india Hero,Octave ,Monte Carlo etc belong to this city with 99% entrepreneurship of Adidas nike etc.) This city was the first one to tackle up with GST and Demonetization and is developing at a much faster rate now. India only needed one of these policies implementing both together caused a lot of problems. Plus india will grow at a much faster rate now not due to the policies or anything cuz of its people and major business cities. Every country has its own time now its india's.

India will always be a very poor, backward & 3rd world country. India's current fast growth is irrelevant, because China until recently has been growing around 10% for over 30 years. While India recently has been growing only around 7%, not 10% like China has for over 30 years. China is now growing slower, but more sustainable based on innovation, high tech products & creating world-class brands. China will always be ahead of India, India will always be a very poor backward country. I mean look at India's cities, it's dirty, lots of slums & high pollution. While China's cities look clean, organised, less pollution, world infrastructure & futuristic. India has always been jealous of China, because India want what China have like world-class infrastructure, global tech brands, strong & efficient government, world-class economy & global influence.

Very Informative.. there is NO doubt that the brutal & fanatic Islamic Mughal rule in India faced stiff resistance at different periods from the great RAJPUT warriors, fierce AHOMS warriors from Assam & from Punjab the brave SIKHS warriors...\nRightly did the great Hindi Poet Bhushana, who forsook the royal favours of the Mughal court to come over to Shivaji to record his glories, he sang :-“काशी की कला जाती, मथुरा की मसजीद बनती, अगर शिवाजी ना होते तो सबकी सुन्नत होती.” \n meaning : (Had not there been Shivaji, Kashi would have lost its culture,Mathura would have been turned into a mosque and all would have been circumcised.)\nIf not for Shivaji and the Marathas, there would have existed a continuous Islamic belt from Morocco to Indonesia. What addition of 1 billion more adherents to Islam would have done to the world power balance or what would have happened to Indian legacy like yoga, ayurveda, music, art and philosophy, is not difficult to guess….\nIt is worthwhile examining the 'what if' of Indias history, Aurengzeb, Akbars great great grandson, had embarked on the 'Islamisation' of India. The Marathas, inspired by Shivaji, fought Aurengzeb and saved India from following the fate of Persia. The proof of Maratha victory lies in the fact that Aurengzeb lies buried, not in Lahore /Delhi or Agra , but near Aurangabad in good old Maharashtra...\nIndian history before Shivaji's advent reads like a chronicle of military disasters. Shivaji changed all that. He used Guerilla Tactics very effectively. Shivaji, as a great warrior & visionary laid a strong and solid foundation that after his death in 1680, there was a series of battles fought between Marathas and Mughals from 1681 to 1707 known as 'War of 27 years' and ended with the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. The Marathas eventually emerged victorious and consolidated their lost territories. This was further expanded by the Peshwas. The Maratha empire reached its peak in summer of 1758 with the conquest of Attock, which is banks of Indus river in Pakistan today. Its eastern frontier was today’s Orissa, being ruled by Raghuji Bhosale of Nagpur. Maratha armies had also reached upto Murshidabad, but then retreated and settled for tribute from Bengal and control of Orissa. To the south, in 1758, territories upto the fort of Gurramkonda in Kadappah district were held. Also, Tanjore (Thanjavur) was under Marathas, but that was a different line. In 1761, the PANIPAT war was lost to the Afghans but Marathas RECOVERED quickly like phoenix bird within 10 years and brought the whole of North Indian again under their control during the 1770's under leadership of Madhavrao Peshwa..\nEventually, the Marathas grew stronger and fought the British in three Anglo–Maratha Wars (1775–82, 1803–05, 1817–18), In the First Anglo-Maratha War (1775–1782) The Marathas emerged Victorious. A Vijay Stambh (Victory Pillar) erected to commemorate Maratha victory over British is located at Vadgaon/Wadgaon Maval, close to the city of Pune. The 2nd and 3rd were subsequently lost and British established themselves.\n(By the way, just for your G.K, Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is also  considered as the 'Father of the Indian Navy'.)\n Jai HIND !!!

There are four things that will make India competitive and only three things: 1.) labor-force skilled to internationally competitive standards; 2.) culture that promotes all people to maximize economic participation (all genders and religions and races encouraged to learn, earn, and invest); 3.) state-of-the-art technology employed by industry; 4.) government that is capable of designing and organizing all the nation's human and material resources into an optimally productive and innovative economy. Since India is a Republic, all Indians need to learn to be cognizant of these four requirements and to be single-minded about achieving them. India will not be competitive and able to hold our own against China, Japan, Europe without these things. Without them, India will not enable all Indian children access to the quality of life their counterparts abroad can anticipate. Everything else is window-dressing in comparison.",0,"1 year ago",1553006784569,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

Chinese aren’t superior, it’s just totally dedication to their work. In China if a conductor gets a work for a road construction and if the road gets somehow bad situation within 10 years , the conductor will be black listed plus he will have to build the road on his own expenses， also paying hefty  fines. Does it ever happen in India ? Anyway 33 Chinese cities have subway system already the highest number in the world, they all started in 90’s, like Shanghai metro started in 93 now the world’s largest metro system with 650kms tracks and in 2025 will be more than 1000 kms of tracks, so the pace is different, cz China strictly controls the infrastructure system .so that’s why their infrastructure is good which brings prosperities to the country. China’s per capita is around 15k now. Also China produces on average 1 billionaire in just every 2 days. As I said their approach is very different and has accountabilities .so they developed in just 30 years.

If we take from an economic prespective Japanese economy & population, Japan should have atleast near half of the USA GDP compared i.e., around $ 9.8 trillion USD but currently it is nowhare near the 1/2 of US economy.\n\nWhen a nation gets developed it no longer requires the positive growth rates & sheering foreign reserves but a depeloping or any poor country have to beef up itself so the chances are higher to have a better growth rate than the developed one.\n\nE.g.- Japan or U.K.  or U.S.A. or EU members pose annual around 1.2% to 2.1% whereas developing countries like India, China, African Nations, Brasil, Russia, B-Desh, Vietnam, Ukrain, Latin American nation pose an average of around 5.8% which are almost 3X of any developed one. This is because developing countries are having poorly infrastructure & connectivity so they would have to mend all of those issues thus by mending those & attracting foeeign & domestic investments & job creation they pose higher GDP growth rates some developing countries also surpass 10% per annum with an ease but ACCORDING TO YOUR STUDY that no one can (including developed world) become like China because they dont need to be like China because they are far developed than China, their roadways, railways & air connectivity, infrastructure & quality of life is way better than China & there is not much scope left for them to be more develop & better quality unless some dumb & dank shithole war breaks through.",0,"1 year ago",1553006794191,false

China has one of the best infrastructure in the world. Those developed countries don’t have any more good infrastructure like China anymore. China used more concrete from 2010~2012 than the US used in the last century . China built 28000 kms of bullet train tracks in just 11 years with speed over 350 km/h, last year Shenzhen put up more skyscrapers than all the skyscrapers built in the US alone. They just opened up a sea bridge which is longest in the world 55 kms long with over 16kms under the sea, currently China is the leader of Artificial intelligence in the world. There’s like hundreds of examples , the reasons I’m telling you because currently no other country on the planet is capable of Doing such things at that rate that what China is doing. By the The life style and living standards in China are really better than many developed nations. China has more than 25 cities with over 200 billion dollars , not counting less than 200. 34 cities with metro lines . With over 250 airports around the country. All they did just in the last 30 years . So tell me can do that at that pace. By the Chinese are ranked no.1 and no.3 in IQ . You can’t compare China with other developing countries like India or Vietnam . China is already a developed nation theirs per capita is jus around 11k now that’s why other than that China actually has the much better infrastructure than most of the developed nations. Because of most of the developed nations did those long time ago and afterwards they didn’t do much, as I have seen in many developed countries. You really don’t have any idea what China is capable of and what they are doing. Many New Yorkers said that when they go back to New York from Shanghai they think they just went back to a country side. As I have seen they build roads overnight. The problem with poor countries like India or Vietnam that their single task would take hundreds of hours or even  months to get passed , then poor quality of work . The reason is that no other countries  can be China is that , China isn’t democratic country , whereas in Countries like India won’t be able to that simply mandate or voting politics , billion people can’t agree on a single thing . And the political parties  would do anything to get the votes , all busy in such things rather than real development.

They were originally a term used to describe A British Father and A Indian Mother creating offspring with british and Indian ancestry.

Indian men also took in European Women into their rooms after working for the british as a reward. This fucked up the Gene Pool in India tremendously.

So it is not a true representation of India. Secondly, I have my complaints against the biased and banal imagery used in this video.  Why show India always as a bunch of snake charmers, hermits, temple goers, poor and uneducated bunch? This is a very biased view.  India is a growing country - it has pockets that have developed quite well and pockets that have not. The Western media is always focused on the latter. How is that a true representation? When you are talking about India 's growth why not show scenes of some of its growth engines such as software technology parks, special economic zones, its plethora of startups in glistening office spaces, its army of knowledge workers, traders on the floor of Bombay Stock Exchange and central business districts of some of the cities? There is poverty in India, no doubt. But it is also at a record low. There is a burgeoning middle class that is amongst the largest in the world.

India will never grow uniformly because Indian states have diverse economic agenda and social policies that puts different states at different levels. For instance, a state like Uttar Pradesh will NOT gain from India’s growth simply because of the low illiteracy rate leading to a HDI trap where the vicious cycle keeps the state in low HDI for a long time. Again there are large states in India like Kerala and TamilNadu where TFR has fallen to levels in some advanced nations. So these states would need Uttar Pradesh’s labor but the low HDI trap men’s these states are not going to get decent skilled labor from there. Countries like China and the US have these issues only to a minor extent. Indian statistics cannot be reported at the country level. Many western channels just do not understand that there are sub markets within India that are advanced and other sub markets like UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha etc.  in the vicious sub-Saharan African levels of HDI, low investment, high illiteracy, massive violence, heavy religious bent and exploitation,. So, overall India is a combination of sub Saharan type countries and mid to medium advanced nations in the world. And just like in the rest of the world, where people in low HDI trap countries migrate in search of better economic opportunities and health outcomes, so do the trends in India as well where people from sub-Saharan level economies migrate to relatively advanced economies in the country. India is a world in itself and that is how it will be for a long long time. You just can not describe India in a 5 minute clip - can you describe the world in 5 minutes? No. That’s what India is, a planet in itself, with all the complexities across the world present in 1 country.",0,"1 year ago",1553006815187,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

Sanatan Sanskriti  or Vedic Dharma. Sanatan Sanskriti  is repository of knowledge with human evolution.  This evolved with the time and yug  (kaal). Dharma has universal application without discrimination. \n\n1. The place between Himalaya in north to indu sarovar (Indian ocean) in south is called Hindu. Himalya Hi + indu. Makes the word Hindu. Used for geographic demarcation.  Hindu kush mountain Hindu river called as Sindhu river all indicated the sanskrit origin of the word. But yes doesn't indicate religion but Geographic. Hindustan is a pure sanskrit origin word. Hindu + sthan. Any word added with ""sthan"" indicates its sanskrit origin. ""sthan"" became ""stan"" in apbhransh and prakrit. Has nothing to do with Persian or Arabic. Read the puran. \n\nThe muslim invaders tried to demean the word Hindu with many bad words to show them down and paint them as bad people. This is how racist jokes are created. \n\n2. Since"" Dharma"" evolved and led humans from darkness to light from ignorance to knowledge. ""tamso ma jyotirgamaya"". There was no other religion to compete So there is no name, no rules for bashing other religion and concept of conversion. You can't bash  criticize or compete non existent.  \n\n3. This is why got more than 1400 books scriptures on various topics helpful in material and spiritual life and this knowledge evolved with time. \n\n4. Ayurvda, Medicine, Vyakrna, Natyashashtra, state crafts, yagya hawan ritual, philosophy, astrology, Jyotish, poetics, sangita shastra, yoga, Veda,Vedanta, Puran, Mimansa architecture mathematics to name a few.  Books are available on every aspect of human brain can imagine in such a detail that only one book Mahabharat contains one lakh shlokas. \n\n5. In short Dharma is celebration of the diversity of Human knowledge. Celebrating life and Nature is integral part of Sanatan sanskriti. Hindu celebrate Holi Diwali Chhath Pongal Vaisakhi Sankranti alongside numerous smaller celebration round the year. \n\n6. We as a layman only know about Dharma as a blind man knows about elephant after holding the tail of the elephant. \n\n7. Most of us are only able to know what we see on daily basis like nature and creation worship. And on the basis of this we criticize and appreciate dharma. But Dharma criticize none. Dharma don't give scope for criticism but enlightenment and seeking truth .\n\n8. There is so much more to know. Since I am born in a Dharma followers family. Therefore I celebrate the diversity of human thoughts with ease. Dose not mean i know everything. But once you will know Dharma out of the set  criteria of Abrahamic religion for Dharma. You will find nothing to criticize like a blind man holding an elephant tail and saying why he is made to hold a snake. Instead of criticism You will question and seek answers. \n\n9. For example when you see a survivor on discovery eating dead animal poo and pee either you appreciate or criticize this. But no one can deny that this human will survive the odd. And Dharma have a complete set of philosophy and practicing sect called aghori. However a few. To make sure that the human will survive the extreme. Human will not die out because of the certain dogmas made by the so called civilized society or religion. Dharma supports all accommodates all. \n\n10. Religion ends at heaven and hell only but the Dharma gives to strive even beyond this. That's Moksha complete liberation. Gives emphasis on seeking, knowing your self deep within and finding your own path. This is the reason from Sanatan dharma lots of ism like Jain, Buddha, Sikh, vaishnava Shaiva, Atheism, came out without any conflict or blood shed. Can you imagine the same with Abrahmic religion? \n\n11. If someone adopts Sanatan dharma way of life. He automatically fits into the either Varna Vyavstha Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra according to their profession or Ashram Vyavstha Brahmacharya Grihasth Vanprasth and Sanyas. Together its called Varnashram Vyavstha for the benefit of the society. I can enlighten you on this vedic Varnashram vayvstha. Mail me \n\nVarna division start from us. Our head is our brahma to control our shoulders are our kshatriya to protect us our stomach is our vysya to feed us and our foot are our shudra to serve us.\nAnother term division of profession. Which exists all over the world in different forms. And this is most scientific division of profession to avoid conflict in society. This Varna can be achieved by your Karma. To fit into Ashram one has nothing to do. Fits in naturally and can stay in any of the phase as long as he wants. \n\nNow it depends on us that we respect equally to our teacher and our toilet cleaner. Which Dharma clearly says respect each and every thing. This is why worship for all not only to teachers. So if you respect your teacher and toilet cleaner equally you are a great Dharmik person. To show respect we must touch feet not the head. Now where you see fault in this varna system. Lots of Rishi like Valmiki, Vedvyas, Ravidas, Parashar etc were not born in cast Brahman but respected worshipped. Cast seems a tribal identity with all the evils of Ego and depends totally on an individual local social environment no support from Dharma\n\n12. Sanatan Dharma allow an individual to seek truth, follow a path or make his her own path to reach the goal of 'Brahma"" the energy and consciousness of the Universe. The feeling of अहं ब्रह्मास्मी, I am the consciousness makes one enlighten and तत् त्वमसी, so are you makes you a Guru. \nThis is the reason encouraged many enlightened soul to find and make their own path. Thus Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism, sant parampra like Kabir, Ravidas etc were born without any conflict. Dharma allowed them to propagate and flourish \n\n13. Comparing Dharma with one book one prophet religion is not a good idea. Can only increase ignorance. Because books of mazhab are small simple and for that for the followers of that particular mazhab only. So better study the world's oldest surviving civilization based on Dharma with universal application, yourself. अहं बर्हमासमी l तत त्वं असी. सर्वे जना:सुखिनो भवन्तु. सर्वे सन्तु निराम्या:l वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम l",0,"1 year ago",1553006820640,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

Who needs foreign enemies when anti national people inside the country are tearing it apart systematically; by portraying an incredibly false image of the country in global media, by sympathizing and endorsing anti-national elements who openly ask for division of the country, by portraying minorities as victims and peaceful sect, when in reality they enjoy immense government benefits and subsidies, whilst the traditional and cultural heritage of the majority, which is solely responsible for India's role as spiritual leader and guide to seekers worldwide, are being systematically trampled on because, frankly, we stupidly tolerate all sorts of lies and propaganda. The current MODI government has brought more foreign investment and establishment of new enterprises and startups in the last four years than the previous government had achieved in decades, India has moved to 5th biggest economy from the 9th place and is soon set to overtake China as the fastest growing economy, but liberals are obviously too stupid to see it and want to defame and degrade conservative Indian values. India accounted for 30 % world GDP prior to British invasion because we were loyal to our values, and now we are on a rebound from the rubble that the British left us in.

I myself am a very middle classed Indian and I have never seen anyone in my life feeling the shortage of toilets in their environment. Moreover, even if India is rising fast and has the second best space technology institute in the world, India cannot and doesn't opt to compete with other nations, we have our own drawbacks too, just like everyone and everybody knows that. And all the Indian nationalists in the comment section, even if India is growing so fast, India is still a third world country, and this is not something to boast about. Moreover, this video is about India, talk about india's development and problems, stop criticizing other countries and better learn something from people of other nationalities. And last message to everyone, in this year of 2018, being proud or ashamed of the country you live in is just stupid.

In fact, I contradict the educated modern people who blatantly shout overpopulation as the root cause. Unlike the West, Indians do not protest for minimum wage. Indians don't raise their voices for comforts or even basic needs. The Indian attitude is to work without complaining. The population which we criticize is the same population which has energy and will to work 24*7. They only need jobs. If the govt cannot provide jobs, we can't blame the people for existing. Focus on the next generation and offer education to improve their standards of life! The high rates of maternal and infant mortality is not because of people's mistake but rather it is the mistake of the govt is offer quality healthcare. 1in 5 children has nutritional deficiency. Malnutrition can be attributed to poverty but most nutritional deficiencies are due to unethical agricultural practices. The latter is the government's responsibility. Statistically, the number of genetic defects directly caused to children born around industrial areas is rising day by day. The disease burden, directly due to occupational contact as well as indirectly due to exposure from toxic wastes in air and water, are tremendously high. A healthy high population is an investment but we are complaining about it. Instead, the government is increasing the burden of unhealthy population yet we think it's all about development. Stop blaming the population and the people!! I feel pathetic for the millennial generation. Their whole world news comes from social media but they want to be blind towards ground reality in their own place. It's all about pointless stupid things like swach bharat,make in India etc etc..

Base years will be changed, once they think that it has become irrelevant. Suppose India’s GDP is Rs. 100 and base year is 2000. Now, in 2015, many sectors such as IT, e-commerce, mobile telephony etc contributes to our economy, which were not present in 2000. Thus, India might be showing wrong GDP figures, since majority of economic activities driving sectors are not represented in Rs. 100. So, our govt. decides to change the base year.\n\n2.Formerly, GDP is the total value of goods and services produced within the country during a year. Now, you take all final finished goods and services produced domestically in volume terms and multiply this by their market prices to arrive at the value of output. The value of output is the new GDP. In this new calculation since the value of goods and services taken at the market value to the formerly method at production value. The new GDP includes the taxes after deducting the subsidies by the government.

Twisting facts to suit your own agenda. Higher employment means higher consumer spending and thus increase in demand of commodities resulting in price rise and therefore increase in inflation. The decrease in inflation currently is because of High unemployment rate. Lesser purchasing power of public and thus low demand of goods, reducing inflation. Thats no good news. It's a sign economy is not doing well. The job the govt is to balance growth and inflation which your modi terribly failed at.\nFyi FDI in India is lowest in 5 years(Make in India failed!), Banks are going empty and hence no loans to credit(another reason for low inflation) while Indian money in Swiss Bank increase by 50% (black money promise failed). All the while modi and his govt is busy weakening anti corruption laws by passing Fianance bill to destroy transparency in political donations from corporates.

You yourself stated that ""Unemployment is indirectly related to inflation, the unemployment is highest it seems but also inflation level is lowest"", scroll up. I just stated the REASON why that statement is TRUE. Failure of Job Creation is a promise of your God Modi which turned out to be an epic fail. When there is high unemployment, you know it isnt a good sign that the economy is doing well. Dont say that its a good news because the inflation is low. Thats an absurd argument. \nBtw your political literacy too doesnt seem very bright. Do check out how this govt weakened anticorruption laws, implemented a complex and multi slab GST (never to be found else where in the world kind of GST) which is completely contradictory to the need of a GST i.e a simplified tax regime. \nDemonetization, whose sole agenda was to win UP elections by implanting a thought into the brains of gullible voters that bjp was crusading against black money all when the IT department had earlier proved that  black money in form of currency was just 5% and the rest 95% was in form of real estate, foreign currency, gold etc hence it was illogical to ban 87% of notes just to find less than 5% of black money.

The US also faces severe underreporting because many women are too drunk to remember they've even been raped, and there is a one-night stand culture in America that is very prominent. The US rape rate is 15x more than India. Just because your western hegemonic media propaganda portrays every nation besides Israel and the US as a shithole doesn't mean they really are. Check yourself before you wreck yourself Malmstein. You know we have travel warnings for visiting the US? It's a war zone where you live.

What about the 15 lacs that he promised to give every poor Indian? Where is the black-money? We really need some good leaders to see the actual growth. Illiterates and corrupts shouldn't be the option to be elected as public representatives. India had already faced such problems earlier and again the same thing is happening. Our focus should be on good quality infrastructure, health and education. Building a bullet-train system couldn't give an edge to where we are lagging. The basic railway system first of all needs to be improved. Similarly, high ambition should be there, but to some extent we need to face the reality and work in the present. \nP.S: I really don't want rants from the Bhakts.

India has always been rich in natural resources and has a relatively good climate. So a big chunk of human population throughout history has found themselves in India.
