India has set a ambitious target of 175GW by 2022 - 100 Solar, 60GW - WInd,  10GW by bioenergy &  5GW by small hydro. However, agencies have also showed concerns on economic viability & auction of wind projects may be postponed \n - Dec 2018 - 20GW wind capacity by 2020 but delays in implementation \r\n\r\nWind Energy potential in India: \r\n - India early starter - in 4th position wind generation capacity \r \n- Old wind power stations has very low capacity & technology - same place can be upgraded \r\n - Unexplored area in oceans - in nascent stage\r\n   Eastern side - cyclone prone but may be on western side - could be costly \r\n\r\nPolicies available:\r\n - National wind power policy \r\n - On shore & off shore \r\n - Solar wind hybrid policy \r\n - Oct 2015 - national offshore wind energy policy framework \r\n   7500 km long coastline - can tap energy from EEZ\r\n - National Institute of wind energy in Chennai - Potential in western states. \r\n\r\nOffshore wind energy: \r\n - Made simple by scientific technology - floating windmills in EEZ below which turbine - transferring energy from underground turbine to underground collection\r centre. \n - Europe is the leader: their tariffs is what India's on shore tariffs is \r\n   They were provided incentives early on.  \r \n - 30GW target by 2030 - offshore \r\n - Need data localisation: Germany - took 8 yrs in gathering meteorological data, ocean data \r\n   Hence, needs high investment. \r\n - takes time to understand business proposition. \r\n - Offshore - 10000cr govt allocation by clean energy fund - collected by coal cess \r\n   pilot projects by national wind energy institute. \r\n\n\rOnshore Wind energy: \n - Support infrastructure.  \r\n - Grid develop - developers responsibility : delinking grid development Europe has done \n - offshore has potential but time to come up. \r\n\r - Competition with Solar - Re 2.33 for solar, wind - Rs.4.50. So solar getting pull from market side. \n\r - Growth rate has reduced as compared to solar \n\nChallenges in wind sector: \r\n - lull in wind power sector for past 3 yrs. \r\n - Transition phase in policy: incentives like accelerated depreciation - gradually taken away \r\n - auctioning of wind projects: tariff determination process - Rs 2.4   \r\n   wind is location specific - \rbidders not able to match govt. tariffs. \n - DISCOM risks - continuous curtailment of power generation \r\n - delayed payment that developers grappling \r\n - Capacity allocation - govt need to trust market. \r\n   competitive prices - prices can go up due to international market change - should be acceptable\r\n    \r\n Future policy & Paris INDC: \n - 2027 - from 175 GW to 275 GW from renewable energy \r\n - commitment to Paris - INDC - reducing emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 below 2005 levels\n - 40% will come from non fossil fuel sector - solar, hydro, nuclear \r\n\nUnprecedented Solar growth:  175GW mission mode target. \n - SECI setup \r\n - methodological \rapproach. \n - prices of panel in world were falling: Rs 14/unit to Rs 2.5/unit in 8yrs \r\n - supported by incentive driven by market \r\n - capital incentive is waived off - tariff supporting is own \r\n\r\nFuture Steps: \r\n - There is a benefit in developing solar & wind energy in a complementary manner. \r\n   wind is better in night or during monsoons & solar in summer & day time. \r\n   Better grid management \r\n - enhancing storage & thermal flexibility. \r\n   solar thermal tech - molten salt can store energy and have at night \r\n - Battery project: driving down costs in storage \r\n - Develop on shore first, replace old places with new technology & tap the offshore wind. \r\n\r\nIndia is on track in achieving the Paris climate target. It needs to be far more ambitious \r& be a global leader in phasing out fossil fuels completely",25,"10 months ago",1558275613397,true,true,"EkQSC0hpdzhqX19jZGNjwAEAyAEA4AEBogINKP___________wFAAMICGxoXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20iABgGMk0aSxIaVWd6VDNWa3VtU2V2R0xfMUpxZDRBYUFCQWciAggAKhhVQ0lTZ25TTndxUTJpOGxoQ3VuM0t0UWcyC0hpdzhqX19jZGNjQAFICg%3D%3D",1,,,,,,,,,
