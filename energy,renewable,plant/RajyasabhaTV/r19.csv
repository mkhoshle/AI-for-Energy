The Chinese CCP model is to fund most businesses with subsidies to kill off companies in other countries then feed off their carcass , they did this to the American Honey industry by adding cheap rice syrup etc to totally destroy those farmers  with  a cheaper but less nutrient rich product that goes for all Chinese goods that have stolen tech but lower quality components & thus shorter shelf life , If Indian companies wish to justify the higher initial costs then quality should be the differentiating factor along with a rebate on taxes paid as well as reverse electricity back into the electrical grid. In tandem with solar cells it would be good to see a parallel system being developed for those cloudy & windless days to which the solution appears to be : To use these forms of energy which are unreliable & unpredictable to extract nitrogen out of the air, store it in tanks then release it via a closed system as it reaches a gaseous state it's pressurized to push the turbine fins @ at that point it's all normal electrical generation equipment that is used. Hope someone @ IIT picks up on this approach as a 2 tier system to supply power @ night ! [ depending on the no. & Volume of the Tanks used ] ISRO is finally getting the budget it deserves & rightfully so , those poor dedicated scientists worked for 2 decades against all odds to serve their nation ! Def. Bharat Ratna candidates ! Dr Kalam would have been "" over the moon"" to see his beloved ISRO finally going to do what he wanted to achieve & envisioned decades ago & it's heartwarming to see so many Indian scientists returning home ! I think Every Indian worldwide feels  7 senses that India is on the cusp of greatness - something that many countries have fought so hard to suppress via domestic penetration & spreading of fake news via international media - Yes Barkha Dutta I'm talking about you & your gang of Anti India & Anti Hindu haters !",0,"1 year ago",1553005801380,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,
