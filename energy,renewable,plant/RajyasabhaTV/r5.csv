My comment in no way implies that solar energy will make us self sufficient(Don’t put your words in my mouth). I have said nothing against nuclear power. But now I am tempted to. \n\nNuclear energy exploits resources (mining and extraction of minerals)and results in wastes which need complex management. Plus it needs foreign investment and imported raw materials. Why did India try for membership in NSG?How do u think the Kudankulam nuclear reactor was established? Have u heard about Indo-US nuclear deal? Also, today’s nuclear technology will result in environmental catastrophes. Have u heard of Fukushima? All this is because the current nuclear reactors are based on fission technology-splitting the atom to release energy and for this we need atoms of enriched minerals. Remember Kudankulam is near sea and a possibility of tsunami cannot be ruled out. This is why the world has moved from fission to fusion tech in nuclear energy. Checkout the miniature sun project in which India also is an investor.  \n\nAll I mean to say is we need clean , efficient and affordable energy for ensuring our energy security.

At least this time u made fewer assumptions about my thoughts. I believe that renewables and nuclear energy is the key to India’s energy security and this means a basket of energy sources. \n\nNow let me come to nuclear energy : India’s current weak economic position and huge energy requirement makes us choose fission over fusion in the short run. This is why the government aims to setup 10 more nuclear power plants(fission tech). It’s also true that H.J.Bhaba’s idea of 3 stage nuclear programme is a brilliant actionable idea. India is already invested in the same. It’s called brilliant because it takes care of nuclear waste arising from the first stages and combines thorium(an abundantly available mineral)a fertile material in the third stage. More importantly, the tech is indigenously developed. So that takes care of most of the current problems with nuclear energy. But still we are left with nuclear waste in the third stage and safety issues of these reactors.  \n\nBut make no mistake : Fusion tech is the future - simply because it is more environment friendly than fission. \n\nIt’s also not that solar panels require only space. Even if we import 100% ,make space for it on every rooftop(which is huge by the way), give subsidies equal to our food subsidy, develop/import the battery tech, the most  important problem would be the disposal of solar panels which is a bigger environmental problem than nuclear energy waste. \n\nSo, u see my friend, I am not blind to the side effects of solar energy. I think u were mislead by my first comment. \n\nIn my first comment, I was indirectly referring to the government’s programmes for 2022 - 75th year of Indian independence and India’s third INDC  to Paris Agreement. Out of the target of 175 GW from NRE, India aims to produce 100 GW from solar energy. Through the comment, I implied that the government was way behind its target for solar energy(actually wind energy have overtaken solar)- the biggest component of India’s total target. I was not pitching for solar energy. Just hinting at the government’s slow pace in the total energy basket.",1,"6 months ago",1568902827606,false
