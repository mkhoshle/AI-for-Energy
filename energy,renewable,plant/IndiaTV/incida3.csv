It is foolish for India to be eager to build nuclear power plants while in Europe and America, they are shutting down the nuclear power plants. It is crimi nal to propose new nuclear or coal power plants. Most of new power generation should come from solar and wind energy which is abundant, cheap and does not leave behind radioactive waste materials for thousands of years.",5,"3 years ago",1489338323504,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,
