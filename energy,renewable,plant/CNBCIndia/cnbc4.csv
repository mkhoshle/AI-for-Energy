People need to realise his vision.  The Solar Roof + Power Wall + Tesla Model 3 and Model Y Electric Vehicles mean you power your home and never buy petroleum again for a vehicle.  It's his way of breaking the back of big oil and big carbon energy.  No one human is currently doing more in this field than Elon Musk on such a broad scale.

Household solar is incredibly inefficient and costly. Doing large scale solar (concentrated solar) in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and California would be the best bet and upgrading the grid with battery backup for the next 20-30 years. I think that modular safe nuclear will be scalable within the next 10 years. Especially with the focus towards process manufacturing off the assembly line and the ability to power entire metro areas in a single go. The cost of solar is in the massive upfront cost and the 20-30 year lifespan limitations, financed or otherwise. Hydro is also another key renewable that could run substantially longer. There are 600,000+ sites around the world that can produce more power than we use by 100x+ globally. It's going to end up being a mix.

Larger scale, more attractive, yet still close to the load for efficiency. Change local regulations to allow business to be net positive on their power bill so they can over build and contribute more than their own load. Many major cities are around 20% of land space in these types of buildings with wide open flat roof space and huge parking lots. If you google satellite view large north american cities you can literally see these commercial zones as they are lighter grey than typical residential areas.\nThis would also be awesome when viable electric fleet vehicles are more mainstream. Charge the fleet with onsite solar.\nThere are many areas in the central part of North America where Hydro is not an option because there is not enough flow to the rivers to make a fraction of the power the city needs.\nThis has also limited nuclear in the past as the incumbent design requires large water sources that are not drinking water.

Sun shines only 5 hours a day so you would need at least this just to charge your car. If cloudy day happens you'll get much less then this. A full charge in a P100D  would last only a week. One would have at least 50,000 watt battery at their house that cost about 40,000 dollars installed. This would be just the battery. Adding another 10,000 dollars to this will make it 50,000 dollars to run you home off grid and then add 30,000 for panels. You would spend 100,000 or a little less to have a system like this. If power only cost about 200 bucks a month you will need to get 40 years out of this setup. lol However to be far one would have to add the savings they save for driving around in their Tesla gas free. You also would have to add up the price of said car too. I think if someone would just get a better hot water heater that turns on when you use it and get a model 3 and charge it up using the grid they would come out cheaper. buying a inverter that somehow uses the model 3 to run your home would be good idea if power goes out However, a diesel gen 5,000 watts is cheap and you could even charge you car and run small things in your home.

Now imagine 80 %+ of people having Teslas or EVs in general. If they all decided to plug in their cars at around 6 or 7 pm, the power grid would collapse in seconds. And now imagine that more and more of our electricity is produced from solar and wind. So supply is becoming more and more intermittent, while demand is increasing. Hourly tariffs will be needed, along with smart charging stations and smart grids in general. Grid operation costs will increase significantly. This may not be a big issue in the US, where electricity is cheap. But here, in Europe, countries with lots of distributed generation or wind and solar in general have retail electricity costs that exceed $0.33/kWh even without energy storage and smart grids.\n\nUtility-scale battery storage systems are great for short-term frequency support (this was basically the main topic of my master thesis). But they are far from being feasible for large-scale energy storage. The largest Li-ion battery in the world is what, 129 MWh in capacity? This may sound a lot, but trust me, this is quite low on a power grid scale. Also, this battery is going to make a profit, but it overtook more than half of the frequency control ancillary services market, so additional batteries will probably not be profitable. \n\nDistributed electricity generations not superior. Grid operators have to keep the balance between supply and demand 24/7 and it's not easy to do that with lots of distributed generation, especially if most of it is intermittent. Distributed generation causes all kinds of issues with local voltage stability. Most of it is solar, right? Solar PV doesn't provide any inertial support, meaning frequency fluctuations get more frequent and more severe - Europe has been close to the stability limit many times in the previous years due to intermittent generation. A lot of investment is needed to keep supply reliability at today's levels (with centralised generation). Transmission system losses are in the range of a few percent, so the main argument for distributed generation that most people use is just BS.",0,"3 months ago",1576170694805,true

What you are trying to say is that the reliability of supply is higher having distributed generation instead of centralized power plants, because locally there can still be power during large-scale blackouts. Let me explain why that's not exactly true. First of all, large-scale blackouts are very rare in centralized power systems. In Europe we haven't had a blackout for decades. Reliability of supply of today's centralized systems is very high (consumers are powered about 99,98 percent of the time (actual data from my country)). So while your statement might be true for specific circumstances, there is a very small margin to increase reliability (even if distributed generation increased supply reliability, the increase wouldn't be observed by consumers). So your statement _ ...much better for the consumers_ is wrong. No what are the specific circumstances I was talking about? Yes, if you have a charged battery in your house, you can power some of your appliances but this has little to do with distributed generation. We are basically talking about microgrids here, where a neighbourhood tries to operate as a local power grid (while being connected to the rest of the power system (which can be centralized or distributed)). If the connection is lost (or there is a blackout in the rest of the system), the microgrid operates with its own frequency. If supply (distributed generation) and demand in the microgrid are not in balance at the moment when the connection is lost, then frequency will deviate very fast (the rate of change of frequency will be very high) because there is little inertia in the microgrid. So a relatively very small deviation from the balance between supply and demand will cause frequency deviations, which will cause a blackout in the microgrid.",0,"3 months ago",1576170695123,false

First of all, distributed generation mostly means solar panels and small wind turbines (depending on where you live). Because the power flow from the high-voltage side towards consumers with distributed generation fluctuates a lot (due to intermittent distributed generation), the voltage level around those prosumers also deviates a lot. Voltage levels can deviate out of the allowed tolerances, diminishing voltage quality (causing problems with devices). Also, solar panels (and modern wind turbines) use power electronics, which cause harmonics levels to rise, additionally diminishing voltage quality (harmonics for example can cause motors to overheat or malfunction). Distributed generation means intermittent inertia-less generation, so frequency fluctuations are more severe and more frequent. Wind turbines and solar panels have been the main cause of 2016 Australian blackout, 2006 European power system split... Having more distributed generation (wind and solar mostly) requires more flexibility to maintain the same level of supply reliability we are enjoying with centralized power systems. So on the contrary of your beliefs, here is a brief explanation why distributed generation actually lowers the supply reliability (the light will be off more frequently).",0,"3 months ago",1576170695123,false

What you must understand that solar panels, although they are pretty black, also convert a piece of the solar to electricity, not heat. So, depending on how much heat is absorbed by the ground, it could get hotter or cooler. In this instance, I would guestimate that it would be hotter, but not by much. But since the heat is on the solar panels and not on the ground, it might actually beneficial for reptiles that need shade at high noon.

This year the average temp was 1 degree higher than normal. I also have a DIY 5 kWh Powerwall, LiOn batteries, on a nice sunny day I can get 3-4 kWh of usable energy which I use to keep the cars topped off and if any left over, I use daily, while maintaining the 5 kWh batteries topped off for emergency purposes. Just the other day there was a power outage, I ran the Powerwall and had coffee, microwave, Internet and other things going, outages are happening more often because there is more demand on the grid and it will continue in that direction in the future. I strongly recommend that everyone get some kind of backup system, generators are good but for long term they are not the best choice, go solar and backup if you can. Forgot to add I have 18 x 305 watts Q-cell panels on IQ-7+ each Grid Tie Inverters they are permanently fixed to around 25 degrees facing due South, I had the complete IQ PV system installed by a local company, and they did an excellent job not too mention a fantastic deal. I retired as a Senior Electronics Engineer so I understood a lot of things about solar power and PV systems.

Or is that something you just say without doing any research?   Coal still provides 40% of the energy in the USA.  Coal is also used in the production of steel.  Coal is also converted into Natural Gas, Gasoline and other fuels.  It is the power companies, who have been closing many coal-fired power plants. The closing / decommissioning of these coal-fired power plants started 10 years ago!  What has congress done, to help Trump keep the coal jobs and keep the coal-fired power plants open?  Nothing ... because they do not care about keeping jobs and creating  jobs unless you have given them a large bribe,  oops, I mean, a large campaign ""donation"".

Wind power works to  some degree, though it is never cheap. green energy or renewable solar and wind and hydro will be of negligible help supplying energy needs, every little bit helps. Unfortunately renewable energy is not here now, it could be someday in about 200 years.\n\n\n Today people especially the young are being lied to to by people who should know better, scientist who do not go along with the globalist program won't have much of a career. Renewable s cannot realistically replace fossil fuels,  most likely we will have to transition to much more nuclear power to provide the energy for the mass immigration of low energy third world-ers coming to our first world nation by the millions from open borders;  where we depend on extreme energy use. Third worlders  going from camel dung burning energy to air conditioning, heating and microwaves is going to demand a much larger utility infrastructure increase. No we are not going green any time soon.\n\n\nDisabuse yourself of the myth we can live without fossil fuels or nuclear in the next millennium. Fusion is the energy of the future and always will be so don't look for fusion reactors or the myth of hydrogen vehicles or hydrogen energy, this too was a lie, it takes nearly 1.5 units of fossil fuel energy to create 1 unit of hydrogen energy making hydrogen cost more energy than you get out of it. Ethanol was another lie and a great tax payer corporate welfare subsidy, much like solar today, to corporate industrial farms, that is still going on with ethanol and bio diesel . We have now learned it takes 1.5 gallons of gasoline to generate one gallon of ethanol alcohol . Slowing the exponential growth of the world population would be the most logical thing we can do but we don't know how.\n\n\n A carbon tax is  the Marxist scheme to tax the first world made of carbon and then redistribute the wealth according to new world order, world corporate government. where the nation state is subservient to the One World Corporate Government. This is nothing more than more corporate welfare going directly to the top CEO's of the policy making body in the form of bribes and payoffs to the ruling elites. You will have no representation or say in policy matters there will be no laws just administrative ruling and fines and sanctions without any bill of rights. The world is ruled by psychopaths and criminals at the top and putting them in charge of everything is the unified goal they are working for. \n\n\nOnce the ruling elites in the CIA/FBI/  NSA/NRO  operation PRISM  a code name for a program under which the United States National Security Agency ... tracking and recording of all U.S. Domestic  customers' telephone calls, stored in https://en.wikipedia.org › wiki › Utah_Data_Center\r\n\n\nThe Utah Data Center (UDC), also known as  the Intelligence Community Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Data Center,[1] is a data storage facility for the United States Intelligence Community that is designed to store data estimated to be on the order of exabytes or larger.[2] Its purpose is to support the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), though its precise mission is classified.   It is located at Camp Williams near Bluffdale, Utah, between Utah Lake and Great Salt Lake and was completed in May 2014 at a cost of $1.5 billion. . Once the elites.have all of your data and control your energy use you will become their slave in a metropolitan Mega city rental box apartment in their feudal system. May god help us all; down with the Globalist. The young do not stand a chance against the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 where the CIA merged with the State Department to create propaganda from the elites  which is distributed domestically  no longer just for foreign consumption. This modernization ACT props up the dying media networks that all speak with the same forked tongue and use tax payer funds to bribe  the dying ""main stream media owned by six corporation world wide. Ever wonder how talent-less dumb as a rock, most of them foreign news readers could get paid ten million in annual salaries? \n\n\nCNN hires right from the source of all their funds, the CIA e.g., Anderson Hays Cooper His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and his maternal great-great-great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune The information above makes it clear why it should really come as no surprise that Anderson Cooper, CNN’s primary anchor, and host of the CNN news show Anderson Cooper 360, also has connections to the CIA intelligence agency. What lends even more credibility to that hypothesis is the fact that, while attending Yale University as an undergraduate, he was actually an intern at the CIA. Furthermore, his uncle, William Henry Vanderbilt III, was an Executive Officer of the Special Operations Branch of the OSS under the spy organization’s founder, William “Wild Bill” Donovan. He also reached the rank of captain in the Navy during WW2 .\n\n\nThe CIA’s connections to mainstream media are well documented. Take Operation Mockingbird, for example, a program developed by the agency to infiltrate mainstream media and feed them stories that suit the narrative of the agency, for ‘national security’ purposes. It was actually birthed out of the Office for Strategic Services (OSS), which, during the second World War, established a network of journalists and psychological warfare experts. Back then, these were propaganda campaigns, or fake news campaigns in essence. One old example from the OSS can be looked at by examining the Career of Richard Helms. He eventually become the CIA’s director, and was recruited by his own supervisor at the United Press International’s Berlin Bureau to join the OSS’s “black propaganda” program.",0,"5 months ago",1570900300870,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

War or natural disaster wipes out your power grid or the power plants themselves? Doesn't matter what you use because having a PV panel on the roof of your home is not going to help that hospital or factory or food market whose freezers don't work when the grid itself can't distribute power.\n\n\nThick clouds block the Sun for weeks? We'll still have geothermal and nuclear power even if the unnatural weather calms the winds and freezes the rivers and oceans.\n\n\nEither way anything that would actually cut power for so long would be a major catastrophe and needing a day or few to warm up the steam turbines after the situation is resolved and the Sun shines again is no different from how badly everything else would fare after a disruption like that. And obviously it is not going to have any problems in the 999999 out of million times a disaster like that is not happening.\n\n\nSo please tell us, how is that going to be a legitimate concern?",1,"5 months ago",1570900303621,false

It has created 7mwh electricity in 9 months.  It cost me $5400 for everything.  It would have cost $21000 after tax credits and rebates.  The problem is the rules that seem to have been written by Big Oil.  It costs $3 per watt after incentives and only 80 cents per watt form mine.  It only took 30 hours to order stuff, pick up stuff and install the entire system with the solar edge inverter with optimizers.  I am 66 and took my time working 3 hours a day for 8 days with weekend off.  Nice little project that has a payback of 3.5 years.  Texas is a right to work state so you can pull a permit to do this stuff yourself.  I got 21 panels from arizona from ebay.  They are sunpower commercial 327w panels.  I had 2 ladders, one for climbing onto roof and other with 2x4's duct taped to rail to pull panels up one at a time.  Nice little workout and very satisfying.  In figuring out the rate of return, I used a Manuity (annunity but monthly) type calculations with all payments increased by the tax rate.  You pay for power with after tax income.  I don't have to show more income to pay for my power bill.

It is expensive, it has a short life span, it is not efficient due to chemical temperature losses during both stages of conversion, and its obvious environmental impact is horrendous. Chemical battery research is 100 years old, and if there is no solution in that length of time it is not likely it ever will.\n\n\nNow, how can we gather and store energy using solar panels? Compressed air. We can double the number of Solar panels and use uncalled for electricity to compress air. Then in the evening after the Sun has gone down, we can generate electricity with compressed air with the energy gathered by the Sun during the day. And if you ran out of power before Sunset, install more Solar panels the next day. Then bring out that Tesla, charge it with Solar panels, and knucklehead and his 40 thieves will have a positive impact on the fossil fuel disease we suffer from today.\n\n\nNow your solar panel IS providing electricity 24 hours a day!

I am a low volume user; my average use is approximately 350 kWh per month.  \r\n\r\nIt would take me more than 25 years to recover the cost of the installation using a straight payback calculation.  Using a Net Present Value calculation, which factors in opportunity costs, it would take me more than 80 years to recover the cost of the installation.  And that is without any battery storage capacity. I am 80.  There is no way that I could recover the cost of solar panels.\r\n\r\nContrary to what people are told by the promoters of solar power, the panels have to be cleaned periodically.  Moreover, they are susceptible to wind and hail damage, which can result in costly repairs.  Lastly, depending on which study you want to believe, the panels lose some of their generating capability over time.  I have seen estimates of ½ to 1 percent a year over the estimated life of the panels, which appears to be around 20 to 25 years.\r\n\r\nThe cost of solar power, as well as wind power, does not include the cost of maintaining standby generation for when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.  If I have to maintain a standby gas fired steam electric station, the cost should be factored into the cost of wind and  solar power.  It isn’t.  Also, in Texas, to accommodate wind and solar, long-distance transmission lines have been built.  The cost of these transmission lines has not been factored into the cost of wind and/or solar.  \r\n\r\n\rI support the move to a carbon free electric system.  But people should be told the strengths and weaknesses of wind and solar power.  They are not ready for stand alone prime time operation.\n\n\nAs an aside, I find it ironic that lots of folks are extolling the virtues of wind and solar as the way to a carbon free society while buying large pick-up trucks and SUVs.

But lately the cost lowered enough for solar to be feasible in most locations. I have seen reports from many users who installed five or six years ago, and who almost recovered the investment, so for two more decades they will have free electricity. Of course they got some incentives and live in a sunny place. If you live in a grim place, and no incentive, and the installers rips you off, sure, it is a bad deal to do solar now. Especially at 80. I am not 60 yet, and I am reluctant to buy anything new, because who comes after me will threw it out anyway, even is not worn out. But for solar is not just a matter of recovering the money. is a matter of keeping humanity alive. Sure, we will go away before the doom comes here, but what about the young ones? \n\n\nAnd anyway, even figures seems not to add up for solar, they are good. Already at industrial level in sunny countries solar electricity is already cheaper than coal electricity. And since you mention factoring the costs, please remember that coal is subsidized too, and the biggest weakness is that is killing us. \n\n\n\nAnyway, I wish you a long and healthy life, to catch the times when solar will be even cheaper, and can be profitable after one year. In two decades this will be true.",3,"5 months ago",1570900306090,false

Unless you live somewhere the Sun literally does not shine the cost of enough solar panels AND batteries for your house may be as low as $5k. Installation costs can of course be twice that. As for maintaining the system, how often do you wash your windows or take your car to a mechanic? Again, it's only expensive if you get someone else to do everything. If you feel up to buying a pressure washer and learning about batteries at your age it's just something to do on a slow afternoon. The batteries might need to be replaced in few years to a decade, but that is not as expensive as the whole system.\n\n\n(Incidentally, the people who keep bringing up how wind farms and solar panels need maintenance that is supposedly not already calculated in their operating costs are oil lobbyists trying to lie to you that their own machines use unicorn magic and pixie dust and need no maintenance at all. Hint: This is not true.)\n\n\n\nFor that price you get zero electricity bill unless you do something above average like have lots of guests or need to heat or cool the house more due to bad weather. And panels losing about 1% of their output per year is not much of a concern unless you only got bare minimum number of panels and keep using more power; in 20-30 years you probably need to replace the roof those panels are on anyway, and can save by doing both at once.\n\n\nSo yeah, it's not something you would get the full benefits from, but for the average family home where people will live for decades, just lowering the electric bills by producing some of the power they need themselves would be a worthwhile investment.\n\n\nAssuming, of course, they get the slightly more expensive but 4x more efficient panels, the affordable batteries, and moderately priced installation, instead of the crappy cheap panels, expensive batteries and overpriced installation.\nBasic mistake, that.\n\n\n\n\nAs for needing standby plants, with modern prices it is better to just build more windmills, hydro and concentrated solar, as nowhere people would want to live has such weather that every windmill in the state has to shut down due to high winds and areas with regular week long 100% cloud cover would have trouble with agriculture so nobody sane would try to put a solar farm there either. A concentrated solar plant already stores enough heat for the night, but it could also use the surplus power during midday to make hydrogen, methane or even oil from air; in case a freak weather darkens the day these fuels can be burned to keep the heat up.\n\n\nIt is easier and better to build extra capacity in the existing power plants that can be held back, allowing continuous operation even when parts are shut down for maintenance, rather than a completely new plant that only operates few days each year yet costs more than every other solution.\n\n\n\nAlso, the grid needs transmission lines because unlike that PV panel you aren't going to build a nuclear or coal plant on your roof. It also needs energy storage because balancing the power supply requires adjusting things within seconds and it could take minutes to fire up another power plant. Anyone who claims renewables are to blame or that fossil fuels don't need and use the exact same systems is a lying liar who lies.",3,"5 months ago",1570900306091,false

Dear, zyg ... please excuse this hopefully not too long winded reply...\n    Our cleverly innovative, visionary and most wonderful sciences' have relatively recently discovered, within say some 100yrs, which is really only just a very few short decades, or so. And then the incredibly rapid uptake of, and escalating, applications of uranium yellow cake, for shipment and further refinement for ""the"" \nNew-clear-nrg industries, was sold to us all, on the premise and the promise of such, clean, cheap, almost unmeterable electricity. And, since 1944 there have been betwern 2 and 3,000 atomic test explosions upon, within, and over head in the atmosphere of ""our"" planet. We now have more than 500 old and drastically accident prone reactors, several meltdowns that we know of, and all of those reactors are leaky, non decommisionable, or too expensive to completely, and safely shut down and, switch off, in opporation around the world, that together have created so many hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of tons of  the most toxic and long lived highly radioactive leftovers, so toxic and so radioactive, and so expensive to store and monitor, guard... and you would like to see more of this sort of enviromental and catastrophic failure to continue? Expand? Proliferate?... certainly not for the sake of a light bulb, some neon sighns and rubbish creating industries... ???\n... GOD BLESS EVERYONE BLESS EVERYTHING ALWAYS AMEN ... is my most fervent wish. And I would love to see a prosperous life for all who are here, and those yet to arrive...\n     Nuclear energy isn't a New, or a clear, or a clean option for the generation of electricty, nor is it an ""environment-ally"" safe ""n"" sound solution for any future option. We don't NEED to  find or discover what we already have. ENERGY IS EVERYWHERE and ALWAYS available. IT IS ALL THAT THERE IS IN EXISTANCE... WE ONLY NEED TO TAP AND APPLY IT... NOW...\n    and i fully realize that iam way far out on an extremely precarious and flimsy limb here, but i do love life, and would dearly love to continue living....",1,"5 months ago",1570900308182,true

The form of it what we use today produces toxic waste with an infinite half-life, nearly impossible to recycle, and you are going to get obliterated when midnight comes.\nIt is truly a bold plan to stop any further war, but it's impossible. De-militarising any society will make it more threathened by it's militaristic neighbours, and disarmimg humanity alltogether will open us up to any alien attack, what may easily be dealt with by some hero of humanity, with a nuke on his back.\nNuclear reactors can be made completely safe, so safe, that it can't melt down, and the technology for it is just around the corner. Doubting the capabilities of our very best engineers for keeping our current reactors safe is cowardice at best and is paranoia at worst.\nThe nuclear waste problem is way better than it looks, as the mass to energy conversion ratio of nuclear reactors is quite high, and c² is a ridicolously big number, so you need next to no mass in order to power your home.

My parents live in a properly built house that is over 60 years old, but the roof still needs maintenance every 30 years...putting solar panels on it might actually make it last longer, but when you can expect two feet of snow on that roof every winter local solar power is just not as viable as down south.\n\n\nAfter the houses have been torn down for being uninhabitable the panels still have years of useful service in them, so we have loads of good panels and thousands of square miles of desert with plenty of sunlight and almost no rain or clouds. It does not matter if the panel's efficiency has gone down 20% when you are not limited by the area of the roof and there are no trees or utility poles around to cast shadows, the only issue is convincing the politicians to stop trying to hinder these projects.

Of course PV is by and far the cheaper option in terms of electricity generation but we need to start looking past Lithium ion batteries. I wish they'd also talk about the ridiculous monetary incentives given to the fossil fuel industry as a hamper to the growth of solar because, in addition to the technical and legal challenges, solar growth has also been affected by these incentives! If I recall correctly, the total worldwide incentives for fossil fuel plants totalled around a trillion dollars last year. Talk about an uneven playing field! \n\nI also always believe that such information needs to be presented with the proper context. As in, despite all its growth, renewables like solar still make up the minority of global production, relative figures and percentages etc. It's all well and good to say that solar and renewables in general have come a long way, but people need to realise we still have a looong way to go in this energy revolution.

You can also change the output of nuclear plants so if demands rise you just increase the output or if demand goes down you just lower the output. Nuclear is also the safest energy producer ever even with Chernobyl.

What are you in middle school? Nuclear is brilliant in many ways, a few you correctly mentioned above. Quick points though, yes they use a turbine but that most definitely doesn't mean that they can act as a 'battery'. The inertia of the turbine acts as a balancing/regulating force that ensures the grid frequency is maintained in case of any disruption in grid operations. However this is not an energy storage system! It is simply a feature of grid connected turbine systems (which by the way are also employed in solar thermal systems) and is a temporary measure. There is however a storage system that works on the principle of the energy stored in spinning masses called flywheels. I believe there is a grid connected flywheel storage system in Japan. \n\nI absolutely agree with you that solar and wind occupy far more area per unit capacity but then again these systems, especially solar, are chiefly installed in arid, desert areas which are otherwise not utilised. \n\nAs to which is more aesthetically pleasing a nuclear power plant or a solar PV field I honestly couldn't answer for you. In my personal opinion, I would rather live next to a solar field than a nuclear plant. They are safe sure but I personally wouldn't want to live next to a structure housing radioactive material. Wind turbines are a little noisy so it's a toss up between nuclear and wind there :P\n\nAs to the ability of nuclear to vary output to match load variability, there is nothing close to the response time of batteries. It is simply unchallenged in this regard. Just look that the battery system in South Australia and more recently in London. It is just not possible for a turbine driving plant to vary output quickly enough (in micro to milli second ranges) to match loads. The closest one is gas turbine plants and even they have response times of around 15 minutes. There's a reason nuclear is considered a base load plant Andreas.\n\nIn many cases there is also the question of national energy security and the unwillingness to have to rely on imports (of nuclear fuel) for their energy needs. This is however a whole different topic but I hope you understand what I'm saying. After the oil crisis in the 70s many countries have been trying to secure their energy supply and maximise the resources they have internally. People sometimes discount this facet of energy systems but it is a reality.\n\nLook in spite of the points I've mentioned, nuclear is still a great energy generation option. It's largely the unfavourable financials and disposal of waste dilemma that hampers its widespread adoption.",0,"5 months ago",1570900318225,false

I'm saying that there isn't evidence that the earth's temps are increasing. What scientists are doing is basically using a smaller ruler to measure the size of a coast. So they are getting a more accurate answer by using different methods and then comparing the new measurement to the old measure and saying there is an increase in temperature. And then they attribute the increase to CO2 production and extrapolate their false data collection method",0,"5 months ago",1570900319234,true

But the rate is based on old data analysis methods. It's a simple fact that they have no sure way of determining the ""average"" temperature. It's a good guess at best and any action on a guess is prone to being a mistake. There is only 7 thermometers in Antarctica so the average is based on whatever method some paid scientists chooses. Follow the money and you will see that it's still debatable that there is even an increase. And they have only been recording temps for a few decades and they see cooling but they just change the logs and say it was because someone wrote it down wrong or the reading was viewed from a different angle so it looked colder than it was ect. Thats what the climate scientists are dealing with, so your telling me they can determine the average temp within .1 degree in 50 years based on that?

High-energy magnetic containment in the current doughnut ""reactors"" consumes more energy than it generates (2nd Law of Thermodynamics kinda applies here).\n\nFission reactors (using Uranium) are massively expensive, and there isn't a lot of Uranium 235 available - certainly not enough to power the planet. Thorium is not really an option either - it performs best in molten-salt breeder-type reactors, and these are very unpredictable and dangerous. Nobody builds breeder reactors anymore.\nNuclear (fission) is not ""clean"" either... we don't yet know what to do with all the waste we currently have - never mind what will come if we upscale.\nSo... if the investment currently being made in fusion research and the construction of fission plants was rather directed at wind, solar, hydro, tidal and battery technology, we'd get to viable energy generation and storage solutions a LOT faster.\nWhile the science of fission and fusion is very interesting (go to CERN sometime and see what they are doing... I was there 20 years ago), it is not really viable as a sustainable source of energy.",0,"5 months ago",1570900319108,true

You only compare the negative.  One thing is better than the other based on which has the least amount of negatives.   The problem with that mentality is that it is wrong.  You have to look at the product, both good and bad.  You can add up how many people die in car accidents vs. train accidents and say that trains are a safer form of public transportation.  But that is wrong. You have to factor in number of miles driven.  You also have to be smart enough to compare the value of personal transportation vs. the scheduled fix route transit system.  Then it's is not so easy to say mass transit is better than the automobile.  Same thing goes for energy production.   You have to think in terms of how many killowatts are produced and how that impacts things from a capital expense and the environment.  Solar, wind and hydro are not free.   They too have negative impacts on the environment.  Birds get killed in the turbines.   Windmills are an eyesore on the landscape.   Dams wipe out towns and farmland.   Solar panels are made of precious metals or materials and resources that could be put to better use.

The power companies have a near monopoly on power generation atm.  Its not about money directly (though of course always indirectly) its about maintaining that monopoly.  This is why power companies are fighting so hard against solar, it would cut into their monopoly.\n\nIf Americans are serious about renewable power, they need to understand its a political fight not an economic or technological one.  They need to break up the large monopolies that control power generation and distribution and form separate entities for transmission and generation.

It is the power companies that are driving the increase in solar generation at the moment. I would contend that there is no conspiracy to maintain monopolies, and that it is purely the need to maximize profits that is driving their adoption of solar. \n\nTo that end, pumped hydro does not contribute to that profit maximization since, as you pointed out, the flow rate of most locations is not sufficient. Hence my original reply that most locations are not conducive to pumped hydro. Additionally, pumped hydro has a political component, that other types of storage do not have. A company will vigorously avoid political issues since they hamper the speed of deployment, hence they gravitate towards installing batteries.\n\nHowever, you are correct that batteries do not yet scale to the GWh or TWh range, but that is in fact the reason for their adoption. Specifically, power companies do not need to plan a massive project and spend the associated huge upfront capital for a large solution. Instead they are currently (not theoretically) spending incrementally on storage solutions that are distributed as necessary (often at distribution sub-stations). This incremental capital spend will always be less risky in the short term and therefore is where and how the power companies are making investments. The same cannot be said of large scale, capital intensive, politically troublesome dams.\n\nSo as this video indicates, solar and incremental storage, has attracted the majority of investments in the renewable energy space.",0,"5 months ago",1570900325689,true

Because if Rosevelt hadn't contracted a bout of socialism that's what would have happened. Economists now realize that his interventionist policy actually impaired economic recovery and extended people's misery by several years. When bad things happen people suffer and die, that's why they call it hard times...""you can't save every puppy in the dog pound"" "" Socialism distributes poverty equally""...that's the verdict of history. I know this because all five of my great uncles were starved by Stalin to the point where they had to eat cattails to survive...thank God they escaped to a place where there was no socialism.   Today people are looking all misty eyed at socialism...they will repeat the horrors of the past because they are ignorant of history...and it's not totally their fault that they were never taught this in school.  I bought a great little book called ""The Generation That Knew Not Josef"" which is a takeoff of the Biblical phrase describing what happened when the Pharaoh that appointed Joseph to run his kingdom , died, and a new ruler arose that did not acknowledge Joseph or his people, and so they became slaves. The Josef in this book is Josef Stalin, and the people who were enslaved were well meaning but totally BLIND westerners who were so enthralled with socialism that they actually moved to Russia and to Cuba...and then they were so horrified that they got out as soon as they could. One of them was Malcom Muggeridge, another was George Orwell...and curiously, one was Pierre Charette, the FLQ terrorist from Quebec, Canada. Pierre Charette hijacked a plane and flew to Cuba.

VOTE FOR POLITICIANS WHO REFUSE TO PROMOTE THIS INSANITY!\r\nThe Global temperatures stopped rising in 1998, shortly after Kyoto was signed. That's according to satellite and weather balloon data from two independent sources. The computer models proved to be totally wrong. The number of days during the summer over 90 degrees in the nineteen thirties far exceeded the number of days over 90 degrees in recent times............ The polar bear population in the arctic back in 1965 was about 5,000. It's now over 25,000...............  Wildfires in the US consumed over 21 million acres in the US in 1938. In 2018 is was only about 4 million acres, an exponential decrease over 80 years......... Average corn crop yield in 1946 was about 40 bushels per acre. It is now about 150 bushels per acre. ..........There has been  a 6% increase in the greening of the planet since this recent rise in CO2 according to satellite data....... According to a study on frequency and cost impacts of hurricanes tornados floods and droughts over the past century, headed by climatologist Roger Pielke, there have been no discernible increases in these phenomena and cost impacts may have actually decreased (this study was not funded by the oil companies either)..... Climatologist Jim Hansen predicted a number of decades ago that Manhattan would be under three feet of water by the year 2018. Last time I checked Manhattan is still above water. Al Gore said the polar ice cap would disappear by 2014. The polar ice cap area has actually gone back to the way it was in 1979. Historically human beings have been terrible predictors as to what the future will bring in terms of climate.

Let's point out what happens with glass and mirrors and reflective surfaces.  Like a car a gets hot.  Take note of the solar panels that shot down birds in midflight at over 900 degrees.  \n\nThis tells me large scale solar is heating the earth faster magnifying literally the whole atmosphere.  Where most burning fossil fuels release steam/heat and clouds that block the sun and cool as it rises, solar is heating up the upper most layers which is likely worse.  I'd wonder if it evaporates the water in the atmosphere keeping it from raining.  \n\nRegarding ice caps, like ice cream once it thaws to slush like mix it accelerates much faster than if it's one big ice chunk.  So of course ice caps would melt faster as water rises.  \n\nThing that is crazy is everyone is in a panic over nothing...the ones at the top leading the charge aren't doing anything to slow it, celebs, politicians, they aren't canceling private trips on yachts or planes, they still keep their mansions.  \nAlso let's point out scientists said we were headed for an ice age not too long ago in the  70s/80s.  \n\nAlso there was an article suggesting that the Earth's changing in fields could be the culprit.\n\nOne thing is for sure we're not heating the earth that fast, it cools everyday and gets warm everyday...heat is escaping.  After wild fires of countless acres burned, billions of gallons of fuel burned constantly, heated building, stores etc.  Yet we still get freezing temps below zero.  \n\nI don't believe it is as serious as the media makes it out to be.  People live in Siberia at -30 degrees, and people live where it is 90 nearly all the time, we adapt and move on.  5 degree change would be nothing, it changes that much everyday...we just need to start building better locations and stronger buildings...we have the ability to live just fine with climate change.",1,"5 months ago",1570900328749,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,

Enron also manipulated the markets by deliberately reducing peak generation. This wasn't a ""liberal conspiracy"" rather a greed conspiracy.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis\n\n""California had an installed generating capacity of 45 GW. At the time of the blackouts, demand was 28 GW. A demand-supply gap was created by energy companies, mainly Enron, to create an artificial shortage. Energy traders took power plants offline for maintenance in days of peak demand to increase the price.[7][8] Traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of 20 times its normal value. Because the state government had a cap on retail electricity charges, this market manipulation squeezed the industry's revenue margins, causing the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and near bankruptcy of Southern California Edison in early 2001.[""",0,"5 months ago",1570900330822,false

Hydroelectric is very common and is usually implemented when it's an option. Obviously hydroelectric relies on availability of suitable land, which isn't always an option for some places. Nuclear Power has exceedingly high startup costs and implementation times, which is why it's not favored. It could be a rather poor investment to spend trillions of of dollars and 20 years building new facilities, when the cost of implementation of solar/wind energy storage may plummet dramatically in that time. Nuclear Energy is a very viable concept, but I think people encounter a fallacy in thinking that the most effective way to generate electricity must be the most technologically advanced one. I'd say Nuclear is a fine option for places that don't have good hydro, solar or wind viability. Personally I think that solar and wind would be best implemented on a micro-grid level, ie: having solar panels on places of use, and wind turbines in industrial complexes. I could see solar and wind being very effective at supplementing energy consumption at the place of use, rather than being used to generate power remotely at large facilities.",0,"5 months ago",1570900331071,false

So leasing the panels, we lost $5 during the worst months, and saved more than $700 during the remainder of the year. Panels were installed in 08/2013; to purchase (end the lease) now would cost less than half of what we have saved over the last six years. We continue to lease r/t the cost of expensive parts that usually require replacement at or around 10-13 years (average).

It doesnt matter how much Capacity you have to install to achieve equal Output if that capacity is cheaper to install and wont require fuel. According to Lazard the LCoE of photovoltaik is 40-46 $ per MWh ( 82 $ with battery Backup), Coal is 60-143 $ (High end represents 90 Carbon Capture).\nI dont think you will accuse an Investment Bank for being Tree hugging Ecos:\nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/450337/lazard-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-110.pdf\nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/450773/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-120-vfinal.pdf\nAs for area use: There are exclusion zones along highways and railways, parkinglots (would also provide shadow) and conversion zones. All areas usable for photovoltaic without landuse issues. In Germany alone their are 1400 square kilometers of such areas, that could provide 280 TWH of electricity (annual use is 500 TWH). Page 15:\nhttps://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/studie-100-erneuerbare-energien-fuer-strom-und-waerme-in-deutschland.pdf\nBut the USA has also the Great Basin Desert, which with its 490.000 square kilometers could provide 196.000 TWH (US demand is 4.070 TWH), assuming 20% efficiency and 2000 KWh sunshine per square meter. So you would require maybe around 3% of a quite barren place, while you already use great amounts of former grass lands and forests for Citys and Farms. Worldwide there are 15.8 million square kilometers of sun Rich deserts availble under the biggest teen, so more than enough for any future energy needs.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption\nAs for the article by Michelle Schellenberger, it kind of neglected to mention that only 7% of all solarcells are thin film cells which contain Cadmiumtellurid, maybe just an accident by an Environmentalist who’s primary Hobby seems to be, to lobby for Nuclear Powerplants ^^.\nJokes aside, while 93% of all new Solarcells are silicon based and don’t contain even leaded glass, the 7% have still to be accounted for.\nNow Burning Solarpanels are no danger as 99.5% of the Cadmiumtellurid gets captured in the melting glass. As for decommissioned Solarpanels, there are recycling plants in europe and recycling Solarpanels is no magic. In case of Cadmiumtellurid Panels it is done also in order to regain the materials for manufacturing, as was done with the Cadmiumakkus.\nShould yet a Cadmiumtellurid Panel end shattered in the ground, one should notice, that only small amounts will be emitted at any one time:\nAccording to national leaching tests in the USA, Japan and Germany the emissions are between 0 and 0.22 mg/l Cadmium. The Emission threshold for it to be classified as hazardous is 5 mg/l (USA), 0.3 mg/l (Japan), 0,1 mg/l (Germany). So only Germany has to be worried about emissions from shattered panels. But since Germany is applying electric Waste laws for the Trash, Panels are anyway collected.\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pip.624\nhttps://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2016/IRENA_IEAPVPS_End-of-Life_Solar_PV_Panels_2016.pdf",0,"5 months ago",1570900332581,false

Alternatively you could create a 20 $ per metric ton Carbondioxid tax, considering that the average Coal powerplant emitts between 0.8 to 1.2 tons per MWh and the marginal price per MWh is 27-45 $, this would result in a cumulative price for existing coal powerplants of 43-69 $. Current price without subventions for Photovoltaic is 36-46 $, for Wind Power it’s 29-56 $ per MWh. New build Coal powerplants produce at a price of 60-143 $. So Solar and Windpower don’t need subventions to be competitive with new powerplants, they already outcompete them. The financial support is required to force existing Coal powerplants out of the market.\nThe money generated by the tax, could be redistributed to the citizens, ideally with more money going to poor people, so that those usually hardest hit by consume taxes, won’t have to suffer.\nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/450773/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-120-vfinal.pdf",0,"5 months ago",1570900332583,false

You can store electricity on the grid, even quite cost efficient, if you cared to look at pumped-Hydro Powerplants who are already an established solution. For small scale storage, say for a house, you can use battery’s, though that does cost more than large scale solutions. For long term storage over weeks and months, Power-to-Gas will be a sufficient solution.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-gas\nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/450337/lazard-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-110.pdf\n2. Imagine now that the consumers do not even consistently demand electricity, but that demand can be highly variable, say several million Americans turn on the TV at once to watch the Superbool, that’s several Gigawatts, equivalent to a couple coalpowerplants coming online in minutes to seconds.\nNow considering that Coal and Nuclear Powerplants need Hours for hot and warm starts and days for cold starts, one should not use them as backup. They are only really suited for Baseload, which’s why all this talk about just combining Nuclear and Renewables is pretty much nonsensical.\nHowever luckily for us, Steamturbines are not the only source for electricity. Battery’s, Fuelcells, Pistonengines, Water and Gasturbines require only minutes to seconds to start running at high capacity. That’s why you don’t have to wait hours for your car or plane to start.\nNow the same technology’s are used by peaker Powerplants to which most storage systems belong too. Considering that Coal and nuclear are currently anyway replaced by Gaspowerplants, rapid response is a none issue.\nAnd note that there are things like weather forecasts and little wind in high altitudes (300 to 450 feet nowadays) is enough for a windturbine (6 to 9 feet per seconds).\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant",1,"5 months ago",1570900332583,false

Compute your average minimal consumption during the day (probably between 300 and 600W) and install only that capacity and an inverter. No battery. Stay on-grid. (If there is an excess of energy you can send it to the grid or use it to warm water). Cost will be under $1000 and saves you ~25% of your bill for the next 25 years (The inverter will probably need to be renewed after 10-15 years). People always want to go big and off-grid, which is a mistake. Good batteries are not available today but they will be in the future.

Now the statistics I could find show that USA oil consumption is 6.875 million Barrels a year (2011), the USA produced at its peak in 2015, 3656 million barrels so roughly 53.18% of demand. So USA Oil production is already not selfsufficient, it was last in the 1980s. The Problem is that you can’t pump out Oil at an abitrary rate. In case of Conventional fields you achieve around 2-3% of Reserves. So they usually run over timescale of 60 years, Fracking oil on the other hand, has extraction rates up to 4-6% but also only last 20 year and you need to frack multiple times, every time receiving lower returns. So Peak Oil is not an Reserves issue but an extraction issue.\nNow USA oil reserves (conventional and unconventional economically recoverable oil) were 37.000 million barrels in 2014 which means they will last at 2015 extraction levels around 10 years. Though note that they will not fall after teen years over clifedge, but will decline at a rate of 5-20% so they will last longer at lower extraction. Now in theory the USA has also 706.608 barrels of Oil Resources (2016), however they represent the economically and/or technical unrecoverable oil. Extracting oil from the ground like Tar Sands and shelloil requires high energy input. For every unit of energy you invest you only get back between 6 and 0.8 units of energy. Ecspicially tar sands tend to be inefficient and you have to see where you get the input energy usually it’s natural gas, but that is neither an infinite source. Plus this Oil is lot more expensive, Tar Sand can be above 100$ per Barrel (currently it’s around 40$, in the 20th Century it was usually 20$).\nPeople consider 40$ nowadays as low ^^\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves\nhttps://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdöl/Tabellen_und_Grafiken (German Wiki is strangely a bit more up to date about the USA ;D)\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil\nFor a longer version about peak oil consider this link:\nhttps://daryanenergyblog.wordpress.com/peak-oil-primer/",0,"5 months ago",1570900332586,false

What I am saying is that solar is unviable compared not to fossil fuels but nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is the most economically viable for its efficiency as well as its reliability. It's as reliable as fossil fuels, but cleaner than solar(if looking at LCA, nuclear emits less carbon per kWh than PV solar). Solar also requires as said in the video, lithium-ion batteries. You should know that lithium-ion batteries aren't all that clean to produce either much like the solar panels. I agree that fossil fuels shouldn't be subsidized but I also don't believe that we should advocate for an energy source which requires governmemt subsidies to be affordable and economical. As for your military supply chain argument, I believe it's well justified that military contractors get a tax cut because they are in fact receiving government money.

Every roof should have PV, but baseload and industry power should come from CST. This way we do not need uranium pit mines.

So transmission losses are  less than 5%. This China link is 1,2 million volts (1,200 kV).\nHVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle like for AC so you have less loses than AC for very long distances. Also cables on ocean floor are less expensive to build than on land.HVDC allows power transmission between unsynchronized AC transmission systems. Since the power flow through an HVDC link can be controlled independently of the phase angle between source and load, it can stabilize a network against disturbances due to rapid changes in power.                                                                                                                                               HVDC also allows transfer of power between grid systems running at different frequencies, such as 50 Hz and 60 Hz (UK to USA) . This improves the stability and economy of each grid, by allowing exchange of power between incompatible networks. \nI think that we have a solution for climate crisis.",4,"5 months ago",1570900333881,false

An electric motor converts around 96% of the battery energy into forward motion, whereas a petrol engine only achieves between 18% and 20% to do the same ""work"". Most of the energy from a gasoline engine is wasted in heat and friction. So... even if an electric car is 100% powered by coal-fired electricity, it is still around 40% more efficient in energy consumption than a gasoline engine burning another fossil fuel - coal's cousin. Here in the UK, in 2010, coal-fired electricity amounted to 52% of the grid's supply. Today (2019) it is less than 3%. On some days, NO coal-generated electricity is produced or consumed. By 2025, the UK wlll not generate any electricity using coal.\nThe USA will be forced to abandon coal by simple market trends - as this video shows, solar power is MUCH cheaper to produce. The challenge is power storage. Coal will disappear (despite Trump being bribed to sustain it) and as it goes away, so electric cars will increasingly contribute to lower carbon emissions.",1,"5 months ago",1570900335275,false

You need to spend more money and more sources to get the same amount of power from solar and wind. The cost per energy is the lowest in nuclear. Yes the cost a lot of money to built in the first place, but the provide enormous amounts of energy for decades so the net cost is low. Nuclear waste, although dangerous is not handled properly, they are easily handled cause they are solids and they take up so little space that its easy to store them. Compare that to gas emmisions which we cannot capture and store. And none of the renewable energy sources can provide huge stable amounts of energy over 24h. They only real alternative is nuclear. The current designs of fission reactors are perfectly safe with multiple redundacies and they are by design able to shutdown (negative void coefficient) when power is cut. So even if you wanted them to explode Chenobyl style, you can't. And you want a real life example. Just look at France. 75%+ of electricity produced by nuclear. And although its a high income industrialised nation, it has the lowest carbon emission per person in the developed world. And then look at Germany. They spend billions in solar and wind. And their carbon emissions haven't dropped in 15 years cause at the same time they take out nuclear and replace it with natural gas when there isn't sun or wind. Thats why on such matters only scientists and engineers should make rational decisions. Nuclear energy is safe and cheap. Not cause we believe it but because the numbers and the facts say so. We have to leave our fear of the unknown behind and focus on the real problem. How to make our energy needs be more viable. And until we can achieve net positive nuclear fusion, modern nuclear fission is the way to go. Im not against renewables. I just cannot see them be on their own. They energy output compared to the area and resources the demand is too low. And too unpredictable. And we don't have the technology to store such amounts of energy from peak production.",1,"5 months ago",1570900338769,false

It's is the cheapest and greenest but we have to examine the case in a practical matter. Remember what happened to the power plant in japan a couple years ago? The nuclear fallout exposed the the west coast to high level of radiation and for several years the areas around the plant have mutated bugs and animals. The water is still contaminated and the place is ""habitable"" after 5 years. It's a real problem. I say we continue to invest in both to find a hybrid solution. Place nuclear plants in safe areas with potentially no natural disaster and find better measures to provide safeproof nuclear fallout from natural disaster. Also continue to invest in solar to decrease the price and improve efficiency. Let the future test which is better.",0,"5 months ago",1570900338769,false
