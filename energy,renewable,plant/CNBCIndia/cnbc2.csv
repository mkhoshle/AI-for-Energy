No other variant. In far future, hydrogen is the necessary prerequisite for new future fuel of energy. It is the mass. Any mass materials can become fuel for energy by the similar formula E=mc2.  To convert compound material to energy, it is comfortable firstly to split compound materials to the simplest form- the hydrogen, then convert hydrogen into energy with more percentages.  Nuclear fusion reactors can generate energy from hydrogen (isotope), but it is only a very partial case of human known form of converting material to energy by E=mc2. Hydrogen is not only the most abundant element in the universe, but also the most simple basic element in the universe. So hydrogen is the key factor for almost future high energy technologies. \r\n     It is now the time to stop any doubts about up-coming hydrogen era. It is right now the time to accelerate and race hydrogen economy and technologies.\r\n     There must be now 2 waves for hydrogen :  1/BUILD HYDROGEN PRODUCTION FACTORIES  FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY STATIONS, AND EVEN FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY STATIONS, FOR NUCLEAR FUSION ENERGY REACTORS.  If build networks of regional hydrogen production factories, then any townhouses  will have small stable lucrative business  of selling electricity to network of hydrogen production factories anytime by equipping  household small solar farms (200m2) very cheaply because of no batteries. All cities can go to the new global trend of CITY RENEWABLE ENERGY ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE, in which all roads will have photovoltaic top roofs at the centers along roads with roof pillars along center lines of roads. CITY RENEWABLE ENERGY ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE urges installing all renewable generating devices/systems anywhere, then sell electricity to networks of regional hydrogen productions factories. Any city houses and buildings can install photovoltaic top roofs to automatically sell electricity to networks of regional hydrogen production factories, and no problem of wasting excess energy, no battery necessary.  2/ In storing hydrogen and distributing hydrogen, we must use standard sized compressed hydrogen gas canisters parallelly with other methods, for example, pipeline transfer and hydrogen liquid storing. Produce standard sized compressed hydrogen canisters. Distribute standard sized compressed hydrogen canisters everywhere.  Buy hydrogen by exchanging empty standard sized canisters for standard sized full compressed hydrogen canisters. This method of exchanging is not the most effective, but is the easy and reasonable way to distribute hydrogen anywhere.  Any mini shops can be warehouses for hydrogen canisters. For example, a mini shop can store 300 standard sized compressed hydrogen canisters. If it does 50 exchangings of hydrogen canisters per day, then it is normal small retail business.  Motorcycles and human sized robots and machines require only comfortable small sized compressed hydrogen canisters.   I guarantee that producing compressed hydrogen balloons is easier and cheaper than producing AAA batteries. Hydrogen can seep through small gaps of cheap material, but if hydrogen  leaks 1gr-10gr  per month for balloon 1kg, then it is not a problem.  We can not build hydrogen loading stations anywhere, we can just build hydrogen loading stations in important places,  but we can distribute hydrogen canisters anywhere in any angles of societies. \r\n            Hydrogen has energy storage coefficient, which is nearly the maximum limit for all known chemical mechanisms. It means that ALL FUTURE POSSIBLE CHEMICAL BATTERIES WILL HAVE ENERGY STORAGE COEFFICIENT LESS THAN HYDROGEN. So . ANY HUMAN SIZED MOBILITY ROBOTS AND DRONES MUST BE POWERED BY HYDROGEN. A lot of army vehicles must be powered by hydrogen too, because of efficiency, even without counting environment profit. \r The most economic fuel for passenger aircrafts is hydrogen. \r\n        New concept of hydrogen battery, which is the combination of hydrogen production factory + hydrogen fuel cell module. In very compact small spaces, people still can not construct hydrogen batteries. But in larger spaces, for example in areas of energy plants, people do already can construct hydrogen batteries.  Should note that hydrogen battery  has best energy storage coefficient, best energy converting coefficient, best energy powering coefficient for almost future possible chemical batteries. It means that all future possible chemical batteries will have less energy storage coefficient, less energy conversion coefficient, less energy powering coefficient.  It also means that all companies, for example Tesla, should take ready hydrogen batteries for energy plants instead of their ""mind  bogglingly stupid"" doing and improving other chemical batteries for energy stations. \r\n          Many people, especially EU governments still do not estimate enough important role of hydrogen. Hydrogen is the key factor for renewable energy in offshore and building marine society. Far offshore wind energy, ocean wave energy, tidal energy and even ocean solar energy must live with hydrogen. Hydrogen is the key factor for energy-autonomous floating offshore social ocean units too.  It is impossible to effectively use ocean energy without hydrogen. HYDROGEN ECONOMY WILL CHANGE GEOPOLICY IN EU, because hydrogen economy is the most reliable way to make EU to be less depended on gas suppliers for winter warming. Best cooking is powered by hydrogen fuel cell, because our traditional cooking creates toxic CO2 + NOx directly in apartments.  When we use more renewable energy and turn off fossil stations, we need some reserved solution to reduce consequences of disasters, it is the hydrogen storing and distributing.  If we use more nuclear energy or even nuclear fusion energy, then hydrogen is a must have, because  it is not effective to continuously vary power of nuclear energy stations, so there are always excess energy from nuclear stations into hydrogen.  Hydrogen is best intermediate energy carrier for storing and distributing on the earth, especially when combining hydrogen storing and distributing with nuclear energy stations.  Hydrogen is the only possible instrument to import and export renewable energy worldwide.  You can not pack all energy of period 3 months of solar farms into chemical batteries, but you can pack all them into hydrogen to sell or distribute hydrogen worldwide. It is normal to setup mind that many renewable energy stations are EXCLUSIVE ONLY FOR PRODUCING HYDROGEN, BUT NOT FOR GENERATING DIRECTLY ELECTRICITY.  I think that international corporations, especially EU governments, Japan, Korea should soon cooperate with African countries and middle east countries to build network of solar plants + hydrogen production factories for the exclusive business purpose : producing hydrogen and selling hydrogen.  America and China, Australia have very big resources of renewable energy (solar, wind), and they can harness much only with hydrogen, then can be big hydrogen exporters too. \r\n      Many people complain that it takes so much electricity to receive hydrogen in electrolysis process. Maybe they have offside worry.  Electrolysis process requires so much energy, but all energy is transferred into chemical energy of hydrogen with very small loss. In other direction, hydrogen fuel cell extracting all chemical energy of hydrogen directly into electricity with very small loss.  The most remarkable difficulty of hydrogen is storing hydrogen. We need some energy to pack hydrogen. But even with that, many detailed countings show that the cost of hydrogen from renewable energy can soon be lower than gas in near future.  \r\n      In the hydrogen economy, battery electric vehicles can be useful too. But hydrogen vehicles can be as popular as battery electric vehicles in the near future when there are much hydrogen production factories worldwide. Hydrogen cars even can be more popular than battery cars.  Many people  laugh and doubt about the future popularity of hydrogen cars, they list some reasons, for example, high energy cost.  But the main reason of the future popularity of hydrogen cars is not in hydrogen cars.  The reason is that,  people must use hydrogen as the only reasonable artificial energy carrier on the earth.  Any comparisons between battery cars and hydrogen cars are no meaning right now, because we do not have hydrogen now. (We have very less hydrogen, and we are still using fossil fuel).  But when we tend to stop fossil fuel, then we must  produce a lot of hydrogen.  Renewable energy is volatile. Nuclear energy can not continuously change power.  Energy itself is volatile too, but only energy carriers are stable.  We must synthesize our artificial energy carrier, which is hydrogen, when we stop using natural energy carriers, which are natural gas and oils.  So we will have a lot of hydrogen in the future.  And the question is that what will you do with hydrogen in transport ?  The usual answer is that we will use hydrogen to generate electricity to charge our battery electric vehicles. It is acceptable answer, but it is not so good answer.  The other answer is that we can use directly hydrogen in hydrogen cars.  When we stop fossil fuel, then of course you will charge your battery cars at night time from hydrogen.  The forever uncomfortable problem of charging time of battery cars will be the forever reason for a lot of people to use hydrogen cars.  Small battery cars have battery weight about 500kg while hydrogen tanks have weight about 40-100kg.  \r\n        And the last thing to note is that, hydrogen is not more dangerous than other gases and petrol. Hydrogen has big energy storage capacity, but when burning hydrogen in accidents, IT DOES NOT CREATE ACOUSTIC DESTRUCTING WAVE TO ENVIRONMENTS.  It means that hydrogen burning is less destructive than gasoline burning.",2,"1 month ago",1581527281226,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,

Just a few comments - the problem with hydroelectric power is that hydroelectric dams destroy the environment at the same time. With increasing average temperatures, evaporation from large bodies of water is surely a concern? Also, they choke up rivers, inhibiting their natural flow and threatening to create what can be likened to an impending global thrombosis. In addition, large dams negatively impact natural river ecosystems - everything in nature is interconnected.. Wave power and electromagnetic power are viable options it seems.

They have made amazing strides on the state level despite the lack of federal support. There is actually a state wide agreement on reducing carbon emissions. This year alone they have:\n1.) increased nation wide energy portfolio to be 25% clean energy minimum\n2.) increased retrofitting standards and practices to the highest they have ever been\n3.) increased CAFE standards once again making sure all appliances and automobiles are cleaner and more efficient, by 2025 all vehicle have to be over 35 mpg (even trucks)\n4.) got clearance to open North America‚Äôs largest clay lithium mine which will provide the world with 1/5 its lithium needs for 41 years if it worked at peak efficiency. It‚Äôll begin construction in March (if the environmentalists don‚Äôt get in the way)\n 5.) expanded their Midwest wind farm once again making it the third largest in the world and they‚Äôve started building 30MW wind turbines based on the Siemens design\n6.) cleared permits to build 19 new nuclear power plants and 5 thorium power plants\n7.) invented a process to recycle up to 97% of the stored nuclear waste and waste going forward\n8.) the navy just patented and released a new nuclear reactor that can produce the same amount of power with 70% less fuel and it physically cannot meltdown.\n9.) the US power grid has become the most efficiently managed in the world and will actually host a training seminar in Italy in 2020\n10.) invested over $40B in large scale battery research and acquisition this year alone\n11.) perfected a way to pull, scrub, and reuse emissions from the atmosphere for a variety of purposes\n12.) encouraged every manufacturer to come start an electric car line, Ford is supposed to present their electric truck in the coming 4-6 months.",2,"3 months ago",1576170494635,true

Agnosticism is (according to the Google dictionary) the view/belief ‚Äúthat nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena.‚Äù In short, the agnostic thinks it is impossible to know whether or not God exists, thus they suspend judgment, and inevitably concede to believing that God¬†might*¬†exist.\nNow, what does it mean to believe something like this? It goes without saying that there is a plethora of predicative concepts that could saturate the subject-name ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. We might be talking about any one of the religiously affiliated or otherwise mythical gods across the entire cultural board, from ancient times to present. We might be talking about god in a Hegelian,¬†transcendental way, as simply ‚ÄúThe Absolute‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpirit‚Äù, perhaps ‚ÄúNature‚Äù. We might be talking about a new age, quasi-scientific conception of God, such as ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù or ‚ÄúUniversal Force‚Äù. We might be talking about personal gods (yes, people, even smart people, admit to having these). So, when an agnostic says, ‚ÄúGod might exist, I can‚Äôt know‚Äù, what are they¬†really¬†saying?",0,"1 month ago",1581527295982,true

Agriculture ( the prime ) , construction , mining are the backbone of INDIAN ECONOMY , we have no domestic industries for electronics , not for military and not for any work required in modern day as today , we do have old ways of agriculture that makes up 60+% of Indian population , so just assuming that less people will increase GDP is not solution for INDIA , it might work in developed nation BUT INDIA NEEDS MORE PEOPLE FOR ITS ECONOMY YET IT NEEDS LESS PEOPLE TO DISTRIBUTE IT PROPERLY , just wait and doing nothing will not solve anything , it will infact make us weak when population starts declining , when work force starts declining and then we realize that we should have made modern infrastructure before this !! THIS IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDIA AND CHINA ! you like to delay our problems and say ""India will be good after population decline all we have to do is wait n watch  "" NO IT WON""T , WE HAVE TO MAKE USE OF OUR PEOPLE NOW , like China did , used their labor force and now their population is stable , they are shifting to management and distributors rather than labor methods",5,"3 months ago",1576170502263,false

Our population will start declining after 2050 so we have enough time to build our country's infrastructure and also develop our industries . Modi's make in India is helping India to build India's infrastructure and develop industries . I know what happening in India as my uncle is in IEC ( indian economic council ) and my cousin is working in Alstom company which makes electric engines . So you don't worry India is a democratic country while China has communism that's why India is taking time but now our country is on track . And China's GDP is not stable it would be destroyed as new dictatorship arises . So we don't have to copy China as they also don't give right to many things to their people . If we will overcome corruption then our GDP will boom up . Jai hind and be positive.üáÆüá≥",5,"3 months ago",1576170502264,false
