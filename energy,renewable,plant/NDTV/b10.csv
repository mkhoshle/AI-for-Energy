Given that India became close friends of Israel for the last 25 years, and then started to accuse Bangladesh of terrorism from that period ? India then, under the influence of that big gangster round the block called Israel has started similar discreet and insidious operations like pressurising Bangladesh to get rid of the non-partisan caretaker government system whose job it was to oversee free and fair elections, as this enabled fraudulent elections and enabled therefore their agent Hasina to get elected when infact she wouldn't have been elected.   India has worked behind the scene to get rid of a separate British embassy in Dhaka, as if to say, we are no longer a sovereign country so we should go to Delhi to access the British embassy.  And then there has been an influx of 7 million Indians into the country for long term stay as they set up Hindu schools all over the country. This high number is abnormal because Bangladesh is still an over-crowded country in need of employment, and is generally still a poor country. Then the army has suddenly been given an Indian boss,.... now that really is a takeover; and then projects like Rampal power plant have been steered entirely to India's interests and to the detriment of Bangladesh. Israel has used false flag terror plots to blame Muslims and use it as an excuse to wage wars and destroy Muslim countries and then takeover Muslim countries around Israel, and now India is doing the same, both by accusing Bangladesh of apparently a high number of ill-legal Bangladeshis (which I doubt is true) to push in 7 million Indians into Bangladesh, and also the terror excuse to interfere and snoop into Bangladesh eg as in this Nuclear Power plant project.  Regime change is an Israel-Zionist expepertise tool, and it seems that India is busy picking up their style.",1,"1 year ago",1551723003976,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,
